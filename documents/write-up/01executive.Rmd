# One-page summary {.unnumbered}

-   `r executive[['stock']]`
-   `r Spp` is a long-lived slope rockfish caught north of Point Conception in commercial trawl, commercial non-trawl, and recreational fisheries.
-   The most recent full stock assessment was conducted in 2015. Catch-only projections were conducted in 2017, 2019, and 2021.
-   There is an unusual pattern in the sex ratio, where the percent of fish that are female decreases rapidly starting around age 20. It is unknown whether females experience higher mortality rates, move into habitat inaccessible to fishing gear, or some combination.
-   The major changes to this assessment compared to the previous assessment are:
    -   All data were extended to 2022, and historical data were updated based on new reconstructions.
    -   This model handles the sex ratio pattern by estimating separate female and male natural mortality rates that are constant across ages, and separate selectivity by sex for larger fish. This is in contrast to the 2015 model, which estimated separate natural mortality only for older females, and assumed the same selectivity between sexes.
    -   This model estimates coastwide recruitment deviations. The 2015 assessment estimated additional spatial recruitment deviations by state.
    -   This model estimates separate selectivity curves for fishing fleets by state. The 2015 model assumed selectivity was the same along the coast.
    -   The method for weighting data from different sources has been aligned with current standard practices.
-   The model estimates recovery from the population's low abundance in the late 1990s has been slower than was estimated in 2015, but more similar to estimates from earlier assessments. The change since 2015 is primarily due to different assumptions regarding natural mortality and different data weighting methods.
-   Current depletion in 2023 is `r round(model$current_depletion, 3)`, in the "precautionary zone" between the target of 0.4 and the limit of 0.25.
-   The estimate of recent fishing intensity (1-spawning potential ratio) in 2022 is `r round(model$sprseries$SPR_report[model$sprseries$Yr==2022], 3)`, close to the reference point of 0.5.

# Executive summary {.unnumbered}

## Stock {.unnumbered}

`r executive[["stock"]]` The stock of `r spp` was modeled as a single coastwide population. While `r spp` are modeled as a single population, spatial aspects are addressed through geographic separation of data sources/fleets where possible. There is currently no genetic evidence suggesting distinct biological stocks of `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast. This assessment does not account for populations located in Canadian or Mexican waters and assumes that these northern and southern populations do not contribute to nor take from the population being assessed here.

## Catches {.unnumbered}

`r Spp` is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries off the U.S. West Coast, with the majority of catches coming from commercial sources (Figure \ref{fig:es-catch}). The rockfish fishery off the U.S. West Coast developed off California late in the 19th century and was catching an average of almost 2,500 metric tons per year over the period 1916-1940 (with an increase in catches in 1916, during World War I). To the north, the rockfish fishery developed slowly and became established during the early 1940s, when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortages of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein. Rockfish catches dropped somewhat following the war, and were generally stable from the 1950s to the 1960s. In 1977, when the \gls{msfcma} was enacted, the large foreign-dominated rockfish fishery that had developed since the late 1960s had its catches eliminated, and the domestic trawl fishery subsequently increased its catches. The trawl fishery reached a peak in the early 1980s (1982: 5,155 mt) and subsequently decreased after the establishment of strict management restrictions starting in the mid-1990s. The decrease in the trawl fishery allowed the recreational and non-trawl fisheries to take a larger proportion of total catch beginning in the 2000s. Following the removal of the overfished designation in 2015, catches increased considerably, though to levels well below those seen during much of the period of industrial fishing. Today, most catch still occurs in the trawl fishery (particularly in a growing midwater trawl fleet), though there is a sizable recreational component of landings as well (Table \ref{tab:es-catch}).

## Data and assessment {.unnumbered}

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2015 using an age-structured population model that allowed for spatial differences in recruitment deviations and depletion by state. The current assessment uses an areas-as-fleets approach to account for different sizes and ages of fish available in each state, but returns to a coastwide population model configuration.

This assessment uses the stock assessment framework Stock Synthesis (SS3; version 3.30.21.00). The assessment model is a two-sex age-structured model operating on an annual time step covering the period 1892 to 2022, with a twelve-year projection, and assumes an unfished population prior to 1892. Population dynamics are modeled for ages 1 through 35, with age 1 including dynamics for age 0, and age 35 being the accumulator age. The model also allows for differences in selectivity between sexes.

This assessment includes updated catches from five fleets (commercial trawl, non-trawl, foreign, at-sea hake, and recreational), each of which is divided across three states; fishery-independent indices from the \gls{s-wcgbt}, \gls{s-tri}, and a pre-recruit survey; and age and length data from the fishery and the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri}. It extends all of these data sets from the previous assessment through 2022, and also includes any updates to previously used data.

Growth is assumed to follow the von Bertalanffy growth model, and the assessment explicitly estimates all parameters describing somatic growth. Recruitment dynamics are assumed to follow the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function, and recruitment deviations are estimated. In addition, this assessment includes a maturity curve based on newly analyzed ovaries; updated biological relationships for fecundity, steepness, and mortality; and new assumptions on the modeling of natural mortality.

Model uncertainty is explicitly included in this assessment by parameter estimation uncertainty. Model specification uncertainty is explored through sensitivity analyses addressing alternative input assumptions such as data treatment and weighting, and treatment of life history parameters, selectivity, and recruitment. Base models were selected that best fit the observed data while balancing the desire to capture the central tendency across sources of uncertainty, ensure model realism and tractability, and promote robustness to potential model mis-specification.

## Stock biomass and dynamics {.unnumbered}

The base model estimate of spawning output in millions of eggs is estimated to be `r round(model$SBzero, 0)`. It declined to a minimum of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_1995', 'Value'], 0)` in 1995. Since 1995 the stock is estimated to have recovered at a positive but recently slowing rate to a recent peak of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_2023', 'Value'], 0)` in 2023. In terms of spawning output relative to unfished levels, the minimum was `r round(model$derived_quants['Bratio_1995', 'Value'], 3)`, also reached in 1995, and the current 2023 estimate is `r round(model$derived_quants['Bratio_2023', 'Value'], 3)` (Table \ref{tab:es-ssb}, Figures \ref{fig:ssb-es} and \ref{fig:depl-es}).

## Recruitment {.unnumbered}

Recruitment dynamics (Table \ref{tab:recr-es}, Figures \ref{fig:rec-es} and \ref{fig:recdev-es}) are assumed to follow a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function and the steepness parameter was fixed at the value of 0.72, which is the mean of steepness prior probability distribution. The level of virgin recruitment (ln(R~0~)) is estimated to inform the magnitude of the initial stock size. Annual recruitment is treated as stochastic with 'main' recruitment deviations estimated for 1960--2022 and 'early' deviations for 1892--1959.

The recruitment time series is punctuated by a large recruitment event in 1968, following by a generally declining trend until the 2000s where recruitment varies around a relatively stable average. Among recent years, large events occurred in 2003, 2007, 2013, and 2021--2022, as well as in 2023 where recruitment was pulled from the stock-recruit curve. The 1968 recruitment was estimated at about 6 million age-0 recruits while the latter six were around 3 million. Recent (since 2000) recruitment has averaged around 2.1 million recruits. Recruitment follows a cyclical pattern since 2000 but has more often had deviations below the average (negative recruitment deviations) than above the average.

## Exploitation status {.unnumbered}

There are two measures of exploitation status (Table \ref{tab:spr-es}). The target harvest rate is determined by 1-SPR or "fishing intensity." SPR is the spawning potential ratio, or percent of unfished spawning output that would result at equilibrium from fishing at a given rate. Because the target is based on 1-SPR, a value of 0 means no fishing is occurring (at equilibrium, unfished spawning output would result from fishing at the current rate), and a value of 1 means at equilibrium all spawning fish would be killed before spawning, and the population would collapse. The second measure is the exploitation rate, or total dead catch divided by total age `r model$summary_age`+ biomass.

Fishing intensity rose from zero to close to the target around 1950, and then rose from the target to near 1.0 in the 1970s (Figure \ref{fig:kobe-es}). Intensity remained slightly below 1.0 from 1980 to the mid-1990s as the population rapidly depleted. Exploitation rates dropped dramatically in 2000 with the overfished designation, and the population has been slowly increasing since. Exploitation rates rose again in 2017 and are currently close to target levels. Spawning output remains slightly below the target, indicating additional yield may be possible if the population further increases.

## Ecosystem considerations {.unnumbered}

Although ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, there are several important aspects of the recent California current ecosystem that appear to warrant consideration. Lingcod, a potentially important predator of small canary, have rebuilt over the last two decades. To the extent that the component of natural mortality of canary rockfish added by predation from Lingcod and other predators has been increasing over recent years, recruitment may be underestimated. This effect could also lead to longer than predicted recovery times for `r spp`. Conversely, Pacific salmon are known to consume young canary rockfish, and their populations have generally declined in recent years. Canary rockfish recruitment, growth, and condition have all been found to be associated with the \gls{pdo}, as well as other basin-scale indices. However, relationships between productivity of fish populations with non-mechanistic basin-scale indicators such as the \gls{pdo} have been degrading in recent years due to climate change, so these relationships may not be reliable predictors moving forward. According to a recent California Current climate vulnerability analysis that ranked species on a scale of low, moderate, high, and very high, `r spp` have high exposure and high sensitivity to climate change, similar to most rockfish. The prevalence of a strong 1999 year-class for many west coast groundfish species suggest that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life-history strategies. Much research is currently underway to explore these phenomena, and it appears likely that more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes and influences may be able to be incorporated into management both within and outside of future `r spp` stock assessments.

## Reference points {.unnumbered}

The management target for `r spp` is 40% of unfished spawning output, or SO40%. This is associated with an annual exploitation rate of `r round(model$derived_quants['annF_Btgt', 'Value'], 4)` yr^-1^ (95% confidence interval, `r stringr::str_flatten(round(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), model$derived_quants['annF_Btgt', 'Value'], model$derived_quants['annF_Btgt', 'StdDev']), 4), collapse = '-')`) and yield of `r round(model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'Value'], 0)` mt (`r stringr::str_flatten(round(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'Value'], model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'StdDev']), 0), collapse = '-')`). The target fishing intensity is SPR=0.5, which leads to an equilibrium spawning output of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 0)` million eggs (`r stringr::str_flatten(round(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'Value'], model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'StdDev']), 0), collapse = '-')`). Table \ref{tab:ref-pts-es} contains a full list of model estimates and 95% confidence intervals of target spawning output, target 1-SPR, target exploitation rate, and target yield for targets based on spawning depletion (SO40%), 1-SPR (SPR50), and the model estimate of MSY (maximum sustainable yield), as well as key population quantities at unfished levels and their current values.

## Management performance {.unnumbered}

Total mortality is generally well below the annual catch limit (Table \ref{tab:acls-es}). However, for catch limits in 2013--2016 the stock was in an overfished designation. During that time, attainment averaged around 60%. In 2015 the full \gls{acl} was nearly achieved (93% attainment). Beginning in 2017, the \gls{acl} increased more than tenfold with the lifting of the overfished designation. Since that time, catches have increased and attainment has averaged around 40%.

               booktabs = TRUE)
```

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties {.unnumbered}

The major uncertainty in this assessment is treatment of natural mortality. This issue has been a long-standing uncertainty for `r spp` assessments, and remains so. This uncertainty arises from observations in survey and fishery data that age-based sex-ratios are male skewed starting around age 20. This could be explained by females being less susceptible to capture, or to fewer females in the population, or to some combination of both. No refugia for old females has been found thus far suggesting mortality may be a more probable culprit, however sex ratios within Oregon fishery data have been nearer to equal in the last decade. Regardless, there is uncertainty on how best to model this dynamic.

The choice of how to model natural mortality matters. Assuming fixed sex-specific age-invariant natural mortality results in a more pessimistic outlook because natural mortality for females is fixed at the lower prior (0.0643) value. If natural mortality is age-dependent, female natural mortality is estimated to be higher at older ages, and the magnitude of the value increases with the age at which the break in natural mortality occurs. A higher natural mortality estimate results in a more optimistic population estimate that increases dramatically from low abundance in the 2000s. Modeling selectivity as sex-dependent, as in the base model, reflects a middle ground in the estimate of natural mortality, in that age-invariant estimates between males and females differ by 20 percent (with females higher), while avoiding the less common biological assumption that natural mortality increases with age. However, applying sex-dependent selectivity results in larger females having greater selectivity values than males, which would seem to be opposite to historical treatments for explaining the male-skewed sex ratio due to older females being less susceptible to capture. Assuming no no sex-dependent selectivity results in a worse fitting model, and also has a different population outlook in that natural mortality for females is estimated lower than the prior estimate (0.055) while high recruitment in recent years results in a greater population increase than would be expected under such a low natural mortality estimate under average recruitment deviations.

A challenge with the current base model is that it is highly parameterized with many correlations between parameters above 0.8, including some parameters with correlations as high as 0.97. Earlier versions of the model also suggested flat likelihood surfaces. Although the current base model is more stable due to simplifications of the Washington recreational and Oregon non-trawl selectivity blocks, the number of selectivity parameters and correlations among them indicate additional simplification may be warranted. Simplifying the number of selectivity parameters by reducing the number of time-varying blocks degrades model fit by a large degree and does not appear to be a solution for reducing model complexity. Modeling selectivity as a three parameter double-normal reduces correlation in parameters compared to a four parameter formulation, however modeling sex-dependent selectivity reintroduces a fourth selectivity parameter. Alternative forms for modeling selectivity and continued explorations into ways to model processes that lead to high male sex ratios in older ages may help reduce parameter correlations, and limit concerns about potential over-parameterization.

## Decision table and projections {.unnumbered}

A ten-year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated \gls{acl} based on the category 1 time-varying $\sigma$ (0.5) with $P^*$ = 0.45 (i.e., termed the "buffer") for years 2025-2034 is shown in Table \ref{tab:es-project}. The removals in 2023 and 2024 were set equal to the recommended fleet-specific values as provided by the \gls{gmt}. At the end of the projection period, 2034, the projected ACL removals result in spawning output relative to unfished to be `r round(100*(model$timeseries$SpawnBio[model$timeseries$Yr==2034]/model$timeseries$SpawnBio[1]),1)` percent.

The axis of uncertainty in the decision table is based on the uncertainty around natural mortality. Alternative structural assumptions around natural mortality were used used to identify the low and high states of nature, where the base model is assigned a 50 percent probability of being the true state of nature and both the low and high states of nature are assigned a 25 percent probability. The alternative states of nature were based on the M ramp (high state) and single M (low state) sensitivity runs. The proposed decision table assumes full ACL removal during the projection period under alternative catch streams based on a $P^*$ = 0.45 and $P^*$ = 0.40 (Table \ref{tab:es-decision}).

## Scientific uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The model estimate of $\sigma_\text{OFL}$, the uncertainty around the overfishing limit, is `r round(model$OFL_sigma, 3)`. Given the significant structural uncertainty in the model, particularly around natural mortality, selectivity, and the processes leading to the lack of older females in the population, this is considered an underestimate. It is also lower than the default Category 1 uncertainty value of 0.5, so projections will use the default value of $\sigma_\text{OFL} = 0.5$.

## Research and data needs {.unnumbered}

We list current research recommendations and prioritize them from high to low. Lower priority needs should not not be interpreted as unimportant, but rather lower relative to other priorities listed here. The topics are further expanded upon in the full document.

1.  Continued research into the mechanism leading to skewed sex ratios and empirical studies to estimate natural mortality rates.

2.  The \gls{s-wcgbt} has low encounter rates with `r spp` in part because it has limited access to rocky habitat. We recommend exploration of non-trawl coast-wide fishery-independent indices.

3.  Similar to recommendations 1 and 2, other biological relationships can be updated to better understand dynamics for `r spp`. Few samples of canary rockfish are available to inform estimates of fecundity. Fecundity for canary rockfish was based on a genus level relationship.

4.  This assessment model does not include any ecosystem or climate considerations, but `r spp` are considered highly vulnerable and highly exposed to climate change.

5.  Further exploration of differences in spatial and non-spatial modeling structure, stability, and results.

6.  Research to inform understanding of movement rates for a spatial model, as well as improve estimates of natural mortality.

7.  Revision of the ageing error matrices, incorporating the new aged `r spp` data and utilizing new analytical methods.
