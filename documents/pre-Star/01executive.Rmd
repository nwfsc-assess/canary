# Executive summary {.unnumbered}

## Stock {.unnumbered}

`r executive[["stock"]]` The stock of `r spp` was modeled as a single coastwide population. While `r spp` are modeled as a single population, spatial aspects are addressed through geographic separation of data sources/fleets where possible. There is currently no genetic evidence suggesting distinct biological stocks of `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast. This assessment does not account for populations located in Canadian or Mexican waters and assumes that these northern and southern populations do not contribute to nor take from the population being assessed here.

## Catches {.unnumbered}

`r Spp` is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries off the U.S. West Coast, with the majority of catches coming from commercial sources (Figure \ref{fig:es-catch}). The rockfish fishery off the U.S. West Coast developed off California late in the 19th century and was catching an average of almost 2,500 metric tons per year over the period 1916-1940 (with an increase in catches in 1916, during World War I). To the north, the rockfish fishery developed slowly and became established during the early 1940s, when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortages of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein. Rockfish catches dropped somewhat following the war, and were generally stable from the 1950s to the 1960s. In 1977, when the \gls{msfcma} was enacted, the large foreign-dominated rockfish fishery that had developed since the late 1960s had its catches eliminated, and the domestic trawl fishery subsequently increased its catches. The trawl fishery reached a peak in the early 1980s (1982: 5,155 mt) and subsequently decreased after the establishment of strict management restrictions starting in the mid-1990s. The decrease in the trawl fishery allowed the recreational and non-trawl fisheries to take a larger proportion of total catch beginning in the 2000s. Following the removal of the overfished designation in 2015, catches increased considerably, though to levels well below those seen during much of the period of industrial fishing. Today, most catch still occurs in the trawl fishery (particularly in a growing midwater trawl fleet), though there is a sizable recreational component of landings as well (Table \ref{tab:es-catch}).

## Data and assessment {.unnumbered}

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2015 using an age-structured population model that allowed for spatial differences in recruitment deviations and depletion by state. The current assessment uses an areas-as-fleets approach to account for different sizes and ages of fish available in each state, but returns to a coastwide population model configuration.

This assessment uses the stock assessment framework Stock Synthesis

```{r es-modelversion, echo=FALSE}
if (exists("model")) {
  strsplit(model$SS_version,";")[[1]][1]
}
```

(SS3). Each assessment model is a two-sex age-structured model operating on an annual time step covering the period `r model$startyr` to `r model$endyr`, with a twelve-year projection, and assumes an unfished population prior to `r model$startyr`. Population dynamics are modeled for ages 1 through 35, with age 1 including dynamics for age 0, and age 35 being the accumulator age. The model also allows for differences in selectivity between sexes.

This assessment includes updated catches from five fleets (commercial trawl, non-trawl, foreign, and at-sea hake, and recreational), each of which is divided across three states, fishery-independent indices from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri}, age and length data from the fishery and surveys, and a pre-recruit survey. It extends all of these data sets from the previous assessment through 2022, and uses updated age data from additional aged otoliths from the 1986 \gls{s-tri} and other years and sources.

Growth is assumed to follow the von Bertalanffy growth model, and the assessment explicitly estimates all parameters describing somatic growth. Recruitment dynamics are assumed to follow the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function, and recruitment deviations are estimated. In addition, this assessment includes a maturity curve based on newly analyzed ovaries; updated biological relationships for fecundity, steepness, and mortality; and new assumptions on the modeling of natural mortality.

Model uncertainty is explicitly included in this assessment by parameter estimation uncertainty. Model specification uncertainty is explored through sensitivity analyses addressing alternative input assumptions such as data treatment and weighting, and treatment of life history parameters, selectivity, and recruitment. Base models were selected that best fit the observed data while balancing the desire to capture the central tendency across sources of uncertainty, ensure model realism and tractability, and promote robustness to potential model mis-specification.

## Stock biomass and dynamics {.unnumbered}

The base model estimate of spawning output is similar to previous assessments historically with unfished spawning output, in millions of eggs, estimated to be 8,150, and declining to a minimum of 515 in 1995. Estimates since 1995 have differed from the last assessment in that spawning output has increased at a slower rate; to a recent peak of 2,651 in 2023. In terms of spawning output relative to unfished, the minimum was 0.063 in 1995, and the current 2023 estimate is 0.325 (Table \ref{tab:es-ssb}, Figures \ref{fig:ssb-es} and \ref{fig:depl-es}).

## Ecosystem considerations {.unnumbered}

Although ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, there are several important aspects of the recent California current ecosystem that appear to warrant consideration. Lingcod, a potentially important predator of small canary, have rebuilt over the last two decades. To the extent that the component of natural mortality of canary rockfish added by predation from Lingcod and other predators has been increasing over recent years, recruitment may be underestimated. This effect could also lead to longer than predicted recovery times for `r spp`. Conversely, Pacific salmon are known to consume young canary rockfish, and their populations have generally declined in recent years. Canary rockfish recruitment, growth, and condition have all been found to be associated with the \gls{pdo}, as well as other basin-scale indices. However, relationships between productivity of fish populations with non-mechanistic basin-scale indicators such as the \gls{pdo} have been degrading in recent years due to climate change, so these relationships may not be reliable predictors moving forward. According to a recent California Current climate vulnerability analysis that ranked species on a scale of low, moderate, high, and very high, `r spp` have high exposure and high sensitivity to climate change, similar to most rockfish. The prevalence of a strong 1999 year-class for many west coast groundfish species suggest that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life-history strategies. Much research is currently underway to explore these phenomena, and it appears likely that more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes and influences may be able to be incorporated into management both within and outside of future `r spp` stock assessments.

## Reference points {.unnumbered}

The management target for `r spp` is 40% of unfished spawning output, or $B_{40\%}$. This is associated with an annual exploitation rate of `r round(model$derived_quants['annF_Btgt', 'Value'], 0)` yr^-1^ (95% confidence interval, `r stringr::str_flatten(round(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), model$derived_quants['annF_Btgt', 'Value'], model$derived_quants['annF_Btgt', 'StdDev']), 0), collapse = '-')`) and yield of `r round(model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'Value'], 0)` (`r stringr::str_flatten(round(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'Value'], model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'StdDev']), 0), collapse = '-')`). The target fishing intensity is $1-\text{SPR}=0.5$ (where SPR is spawning potential ratio), which leads to an equilibrium spawning output of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 0)` million eggs (`r stringr::str_flatten(round(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'Value'], model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'StdDev']), 0), collapse = '-')`).

## Management performance {.unnumbered}

Total mortality is generally well below the annual catch limit. However, from 2013--2016 the stock was designated as overfished. During that time, attainment averaged around 60%, though in 2015 the full \gls{acl} was nearly achieved (93% attainment). Beginning, in 2017, the \gls{acl} increased more than tenfold with the lifting of the overfished designation. Since that time, catches have increased and attainment has averaged around 40%.

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties {.unnumbered}

Although not required before the STAR panel, below is a description of problems and uncertainties as identified by the STAT to help guide discussion during review. This section will be more fully completed following the STAR panel.

The major uncertainty in the opinion of the STAT is treatment of natural mortality. This issue has been a long-standing uncertainty for `r spp` assessments, and remains so. This uncertainty arises from observations in survey and fishery data that age-based sex-ratios are male skewed starting around age 20. This could be explained by females being less susceptible to capture, or to fewer females in the population, or to some combination of both. No refugia for old females has been found thus far suggesting mortality may be a more probable culprit, however sex ratios within Oregon fishery data have been nearer to equal in the last decade. Regardless, there is uncertainty on how best to model this dynamic.

The choice of how to model natural mortality matters. Assuming sex-specific age-invariant natural mortality results in a more pessimistic outlook, because With the added length and age samples, natural mortality for females is estimated near to the prior estimate (0.066). If natural mortality is age-dependent, female natural mortality is estimated to be higher at older ages, and the magnitude of the value increases with the age at which the break in natural mortality occurs. A higher natural mortality estimate results in a more optimistic population estimate that increases dramatically from low abundance in the 2000s. Modeling selectivity as sex-dependent, as in the base model, reflects a middle ground in the estimate of natural mortality, in that age-invariant estimates between males and females differ by 18 percent (with females higher), while avoiding the less common biological assumption that natural mortality increases with age.

A challenge with the current base model is that the likelihood surface around the maximum likelihood estimate is flat, likely due to the number of selectivity parameters and correlation among them. Jittering suggests that solutions on the likelihood surface near to the base model produce similar population trajectories, giving support for a similar region of estimates on the likelihood surface (i.e., jittering finds estimates with lower negative log-likelihoods, but within the same mode). Modeling selectivity as a three parameter double-normal reduces correlation in parameters compared to a four parameter formulation; however modeling sex-dependent selectivity reintroduces a fourth selectivity parameter. Simplifying the number of selectivity parameters by reducing the number of time-varying blocks degrades model fit by a large degree and does not appear to be a solution for reducing model complexity.

## Decision table and projections {.unnumbered}

These are to be completed after the STAR panel

## Scientific uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The model estimate of $\sigma_\text{OFL}$, the uncertainty around the overfishing limit, is `r round(model$OFL_sigma, 3)`. Given the significant structural uncertainty in the model, particularly around natural mortality, selectivity, and the processes leading to the lack of older females in the population, this is considered an underestimate. It is also lower than the default Category 1 uncertainty value of 0.5, so projections will use the default value of $\sigma_\text{OFL} = 0.5$.

## Research and data needs {.unnumbered}

We list current research recommendations and prioritize them from high to low. Lower priority needs should not not be interpreted as unimportant, but rather lower relative to other priorities listed here.

1.  Continued research into the rationale for skewed sex ratios and empirical studies to estimate natural mortality rates, as well as basic life history research for fecundity and growth. This remains a critical uncertainty for canary rockfish, as well as other species of rockfish along the U.S. West Coast, but one that remains largely unknown. The rate of natural mortality as well as whether and to what extent it increases with age is a major source of uncertainty for this assessment, as it has been for past assessments. Recent evidence suggesting sex ratios are nearer unity may be informative, but further research to understand the mechanism by which this occurs would be beneficial for understand the ability of `r spp` to recover. (High)

2.  The \gls{s-wcgbt} has low encounter rates with `r spp` in part because it has limited access to rocky habitat. We recommend exploration of a non-trawl coast-wide fishery-independent indices. This could mean an expansion of the \gls{s-hkl} into more northern waters, or taking advantage of developments in model-based index standardization to stitch together multiple similar overlapping fishery-independent non-trawl sampling programs that have occurred over smaller spatial and temporal scales than the \gls{s-wcgbt}. This also has the potential to provide biological data in a variety of habitats and across latitudinal gradients which when aged using current best practices can help inform biological parameters that have been suggested by Brooks [-@Brooks_thesis_2021] to occur above the southern range of canary rockfish but were not seen to the same extent in current \gls{s-wcgbt} data. (Medium)

3.  Similar to recommendations 1 and 2, other biological relationships can be updated to better understand dynamics for `r spp`. Few samples of canary rockfish are available to inform estimates of fecundity. Fecundity for canary rockfish was based on a genus level relationship from @dick_meta-analysis_2017. The resulting curve from these two relationships did not greatly differ but did result in changes in the spawning output within the bridging analysis. Greater species-specific information on canary rockfish fecundity would ensure that biological relationships better reflect individual species dynamics should they differ from other species in their genus. (Medium)

4.  This assessment model does not include any ecosystem or climate considerations, but `r spp` are considered highly vulnerable and highly exposed to climate change. To date, most research has relied on non-mechanistic basin-scale indices that may not be reliable predictors of how environmental conditions will impact productivity moving forward. In addition, the lack of correspondence between recruitment deviations estimated in this assessment and in British Columbia is concerning, as recruitment deviations are often used as response variables to understand environmental drivers of productivity. We recommend further research into environmental drivers of canary rockfish productivity to understand how future and past climate change impact both short-term and long-term changes in productivity. Doing this research in a multispecies manner across groundfish species, particularly those with similar life histories, may lead to more statistical power to gain new insight. (Medium)

5.  Further exploration of differences in spatial and non-spatial modeling structure, stability, and results. The structure of `r spp` stock assessments has varied over time. The 2015 assessment added population structure so as to more explicitly describe potential regional differences in depletion. For this assessment we return to a coastwide model for reasons explain previously. Although the 2015 model showed little difference in results between a spatial and coastwide model, which is also supported through bridging analyses both before and after data weighting, balancing spatial explorations of differences in exploitation, movement, or biological patterns with the realities of model complexity and stability within the time frame of production stock assessments is challenging. Given that this issue could apply to other species in addition to `r spp` we suggest the possibility of establishing a process by which research-based assessments can be done to explore these issues, similar to the research track process on the east coast of the U.S. (Medium)

6.  Research to inform understanding of movement rates for a spatial model, as well as improve estimates of natural mortality. Large scale movement patterns for `r spp` are generally unknown. However, even a small number of tagging samples collected intermittently can improve model estimates [@goethel_tagging_2019]. Any method that determines both the extent and direction of movement would be useful; the method need not be limited to tagging. (Low)

7.  Ageing error matrices were not updated from the 2015 assessment. Revision of the ageing error matrices, incorporating the new aged `r spp` data and utilizing new analytical methods are topics for future research. Potential bias in ageing of old `r spp` based on bomb-radiocarbon data (A. Stephens, \gls{nwfsc}, personal communication, May 2023) should also be considered in these analyses. (Low)
