## Data and assessment{-}

This assessment uses the stock assessment framework
Stock Synthesis 
```{r es-modelversion, echo=FALSE} 
if (exists("model")) {
  strsplit(model$SS_version,";")[[1]][1]
}
```
(SS3).

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2015 using an age-structured population model that allowed for spatial differences in recruitment deviations and depletion by state. The current assessment uses an areas-as-fleets approach to account for different sizes and ages of fish available in each state, but returns to a coastwide population model configuration. 

This assessment includes updated catches from five fleets, each of which is divided across three states, fishery-independent indices from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri}, age and length data from the fishery and surveys, and a pre-recruit survey. It extends all of these data sets from the previous assessment to 2022. In addition, this assessment includes a maturity curve based on newly analyzed ovaries, other updated biological relationships, new assumptions on the modeling of natural mortality, and updated age data from additional aged otoliths from the 1986 \gls{s-tri} and other years and sources.

## Ecosystem considerations{-}

Replace text with
a summary of reviewed environmental and ecosystem factors that appear to be correlated with stock dynamics.
These may include variability in they physical environment, habitat, competitors, prey, or predators that directly or indirectly affects the stock's status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity/recruitment) or range and distribution.
Note which, if any, ecosystem factors are used in the assessment and how (e.g., as background information, in data preparations, as data inputs, in decisions about model structure).

## Reference points{-}

Replace text with
management targets and definition of overfishing, including the harvest rate that brings the stock to equilibrium at $B_{40\%}$, i.e., the $B_{MSY}$ proxy and the equilibrium stock size that results from fishing at the default harvest rate, i.e., the $F_{MSY}$ proxy.
Include Table of estimated reference points for ssb, SPR, exploitation rate, and yield based on SSB proxy for MSY, SPR proxy for MSY, and estimated MSY values.
