## Total removals

Removals (1892-2022) for canary rockfish were compiled from multiple data sources. This assessment includes total removals (landings plus dead discards) by state for the following fleets: trawl, non-trawl, recreational, foreign trawl, and at-sea hake. A summary of total removals are provided in Table 5, Table 6, and Figure 2.

## Fishery-Dependent Data

Commercial landings of rockfish and the biological characteristics of these landings were not consistently sampled for scientific purposes until the early 1960s (Niska, 1976). Statewide sampling programs to determine species compositions of the landed catches began in the late 1960s. The first rigorous monitoring programs that included routine collection of biological data (e.g., sex, age, size, maturity states, etc.) were begun in 1980. Currently, port biologists employed by each state fishery agency (\gls{cdfw}, \gls{odfw}, \gls{wdfw}) collect species-composition information and biological data from the landed catches of commercial trawling vessels that have completed their fishing trips. The sampling sites are commonly processing facilities located at ports along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. The monitoring programs currently in place are generally based on stratified, multistage sampling designs.

Commercial length-frequency distributions were developed for each fleet for which observations were available, following the same bin structure as was used for research observations. For each fleet, the raw observations (compiled from \gls{pacfin}) were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. These expanded length observations were then combined within years for each fleet. Age frequencies were computed in the same manner. Sampling statistics for each fleet and year are given in , and clearly show the different sampling targets employed over different time periods and between state agencies.

The weighted length-frequency distributions are shown in . The annual observations were recorded as unidentified sex; both sexes were combined and are treated as such in the model. By fleet, a number of important patterns are visible in the data. The trawl fleets for each state, although the data are noisy, appear to show a decline in mean length of the catch from 1978 to 2000 (figures), with an increase in the mean length for recent years of the landed catch. The length composition data from the non-trawl fleet are much sparser compared to the trawl fleet making it difficult to discern a pattern in the mean length landed (Figures). The at-sea hake fishery was comprised of larger lengths relative to the trawl fishery, with the majority of length samples from Washington (Figures). All three recreational fleets appear to generally target smaller fish relative to the other fleets (Figures).

Marginal commercial age-frequency distributions were compiled and are presented in FIGURES. Age composition samples are expanded similarly to the commercial length samples (i.e., first by sample, and then by trip). We expand age composition samples independently for each state, and also separately for three age determination categories: (1) ages read by using break-and-burn methods by \gls{odfw} or CAPS, (2) ages read by break-and-burn methods by \gls{wdfw}, and (3) ages read using surface methods by any lab. Age data for California were very sparse (no data between 1986 and 2000), but the majority of observed fish being younger than age 19 in recent years (Figure 24). Age compositions for the Oregon trawl fleet show a clear decline in both males and females older than \~ age 20 from the mid-1980s to recent years (Figure 25). In Washington, although missing age data from much of the time-series, there are larger proportions of older ages compared to the other two states (Figure 26). Age data for the non-trawl fleet for all states is sparse enough that little pattern can reliably be discerned (Figure 27-Figure 29). Age data from the at-sea hake fishery was available for 2003-2013 and shows little pattern. Washington is the only state with age data from the recreational fleets, and these data show a larger portion of the sample fish being less than 10 years of age (Figure 33).

In aggregate, the biological data from fishery sources shows no evidence of strong year-classes moving through the population. This could be due to low recruitment variability, noisy data, or both. Further, declines in mean size and age seem to show a latitudinal cline, with more extreme declines to the south, and limited declines observed in Washington and Oregon.

### Commercial data by State

#### Washington

The historical landings (1935-1965) for Washington were retained from the last full assessment (see Stewart 2007 for additional details). The landings from 1966-1980 were compiled from three different sources; 1966 from Hongskul (1975), 1967-1969 from Tagart and Kimura (1982), and 1970-1980 from WDFW fish ticket estimates.

In 1966, the \gls{wdfw} initiated a sampling program to estimate landings of each rockfish species within these mixed species complexes. Tagart and Kimura (1982) described methodology employed in calculating rockfish landings by species based on data collected by the WDFW sampling program, providing a time series of canary rockfish landings by year between 1967 and 1969. and Tagart and Kimura (1982) The rockfish landings for 1966 were compiled by Hongskul (1975). However, no species-specific catches were estimated. To derive estimates of canary rockfish from rockfish landings for 1966, the proportion of canary rockfish in landings from 1967-1969 was estimated from the Tagart and Kimura (1982) data set. There was no available information for historical non-trawl landing in Washington. Recent landings (1981-2014) for these two gear types were obtained from \gls{pacfin} retrieval dated March 3, 2015, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).

#### Oregon

In Oregon, historical commercial landings from 1892 to 1986 were provided by \gls{odfw} [@karnowski_historical_2014]. Landings from 1987 -- 1999 were compiled from a combination of \gls{pacfin}, the central repository for West coast commercial landings (extracted on 01/26/2023), and a separate \gls{odfw} reconstruction that delineated species-specific landings in the unspecified categories on \gls{pacfin} [e.g. URCK and POP1, @odfw2017informational]. Canary rockfish landings from this reconstruction were substituted for the URCK and POP1 landings available from \gls{pacfin} and added to \gls{pacfin} landings from other categories for a complete time series during this time period. Commercial landings from 2000 -- 2022 are available on \gls{pacfin} (extracted on <ADD DATE>).

#### California

Historical commercial fishery landings of canary rockfish from 1916-1980 were obtained as in as in @dick2021vermillion. Briefly, catches from 1916-1968 came from a state reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. From 1969-1980, data came from \gls{calcom}. Additional catches caught off the coast of Oregon or Washington but landed in California from 1948-1968 were also included (E. Dick, personal communication, 3/16/23, per the PFMC accepted practices for groundfish assessment). These final catches are the California landings history for consistency, because historical catches landed into Oregon or Washington but caught in the other state's waters are not currently able to be separated so are attributed to the state where they were landed. Recent landings by trawl and hook & line gear types (1981-2022) were obtained from \gls{pacfin} DATE.

### Recreational data by state

Estimates of recreational catch from 1928-2014 were generated through use of \gls{recfin} and also obtained directly from the states. \gls{recfin} contains data for the years of 1980-2014 with estimates in the early period based on data gathered using \gls{mrfss} sampling protocols. However, in more recent years, estimates for some segments of the recreational fishery have relied primarily on data collection programs administered by the state agencies. The \gls{mrfss} procedure has generally been used to estimate effort of recreational fishermen, through use of phone surveys, and species catch composition and CPUE through port sampling of individual trips.

California: Historical estimates from 1928-1979 were obtained from the California historical catch reconstruction available through CALCOM. Recreational catches for California from 1981-1989 and 1993-2013 were obtained from RecFIN. Missing data from 1990-1992 were interpolated based on adjacent years for Oregon and California. The removals for 1980 contained in RecFIN were not used due to survey quality problems (Karpov et al. 1995, Cope and Key 2009). The catch for this year for California and Oregon were estimated by extrapolating between the removals in 1979 and 1981.

DELETE?

Recreational length-frequency distributions were compiled from data available through RecFIN for California, while data were obtained from Oregon (A. Dauble, personal communication) and Washington (P. Weyland, personal communication). Age-frequencies were only available for Washington (P. Weyland, personal

#### Length Compositions

Recreational length samples were obtained from two primary sources: MRFSS and RecFIN (ORBS). ODFW special project sampling data were considered but given the high sample sizes available from standard sampling, these data were not utilized. From 1980 -- 1989 and from 1993 -- 2000, the MRFSS program collected samples from both ocean and inland (estuary) areas (n = 46,656). ODFW provided MRFSS samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values (n = 7,176). From 1980 -- 1989, total lengths (mm) were collected by MRFSS, which were converted to fork length. From 1993 -- 2000, fork length (mm) was collected. Length samples from 2001 -- 2022 from the ORBS sampling program are available on RecFIN (n = 27,135). All ORBS samples are by fork length (mm). The vast majority (99.4%) of these samples are from ocean trips (n = 26,985). Table X details sample sizes by year and recreational fleet.

#### Washington

Washington recreational catch came from Washington Sport Catches provided by \gls{wdfw} for 1967 and 1975-2022. Catch estimates from 1990 forward were completely reworked by the \gls{wdfw} sport sampling unit since the previous assessment. For 1968-1975, a linear ramp between the values in 1967 and 1976 was used to approximate removals. Recreational catches were assumed zero prior to 1967. Number of released fish is available for 2002-2022, with release rate by depth available for 2005-2022. We used the average release rate by depth from 2005-2007 for 2000-2004 when no depth-specific information was available. We used the total release rate from 2002 for 2000 and 2001, which had no release information. All three years shared a two canary daily limit per state regulations. We assumed zero recreational releases prior to 2000 when canary rockfish was included as part of a ten rockfish daily limit, and release rates were generally low (P. Anderson, personal communication, 3/20/23).

The release mortality by depth was determined HOW.

Length compositions were provided by \gls{wdfw}, as well. At least one sample is available from 1981-1983, 1987, 1995-1998, and 2002-2022.

Washington sport catches were available in numbers of fish. We converted numbers of fish to biomass using length composition data from WDFW. BRIAN HOW DID YOU DO THIS? We used the applicable \gls{recfin} length-weight relationship of $W = aL^b$ where $a = 1.04058\text{E}-08$ and $b = 3.084136662$.

##### Historic Ocean Boat Landings (1979 -- 2000)

Recently, \gls{odfw} undertook an effort to comprehensively reconstruct all marine fish recreational ocean boat landings prior to 2001 [@whitman2023, in review]. Reconstructed catch estimates from the \gls{orbs} improve upon estimates from the federal \gls{mrfss}, which have known biases related to effort estimation and sampling [@vanvoorhees2000] that resulted in catch estimates considered implausible by \gls{odfw}. However, the \gls{orbs} sample estimates are known to lack the comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of \gls{mrfss} Addressing this coverage issue is a major part of this reconstruction. In general, the base data and methodology for these reconstructed estimates are consistent with recent assessments for other nearshore species [@cope2021vermillion_or; @langseth2021quillback_or; @taylor2021lingcod_n; @wetzel2021copper_or].

Prior to 2001, \gls{orbs} monitored marine species in both multi-species categories, such as rockfish, flatfish, and other miscellaneous fishes, and as individual species, such as lingcod or halibut. For this comprehensive reconstruction, four species categories were selected to reconstruct, including rockfish, lingcod, flatfish and miscellaneous, which constitute the bulk of the managed marine fish species. Canary rockfish are a component of the rockfish species category.

Category-level estimates were expanded to account for gaps in sampling coverage in two separate pathways. First, estimates from five major ports were expanded to include unsampled winter months in years lacking complete coverage. Expansions were based on available year-round sampling data and excluded years where regulations may have impacted the temporal distribution of catch. Second, all other minor port estimates were expanded to include seasonal estimates in years lacking any sampling based on the amount of minor port catch as compared to all major port estimates. A subset of landings were sampled by ORBS for species compositions within these categories. Once category-level landings were comprehensive in space and time, species compositions were applied for the three multi-species categories, including rockfish, flatfish and miscellaneous fish. Borrowing rules for species compositions were specific to the category and determined based on a series of regression tree analyses that detailed the importance of each domain (year, month, port and fishing mode) to variability in compositions.

Ocean boat estimates from 1979 -- 2000 in numbers of fish of canary rockfish from the above described methods were converted to biomass using biological samples from MRFSS (personal communication, A. Whitman, ODFW). \Gls{mrfss} biological data are available from 1980 -- 1989 and 1993 -- 2000. An annual average weight was applied to the total annual number of fish to obtain an annual biomass estimate of the landings. Several years missing biological data (1979, 1990 -- 1992) were filled in using neighboring years or interpolation. These landings in biomass were provided by ODFW and do not include an estimate of discarded fish. Landings during this time period average 29.9 mt and are of similar magnitude to the previous assessment, though landings appear to have less interannual variability than the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015]. Landings from 1973 to 1978 were initiated at zero in 1973 and ramped up to the initial biomass estimate from 1979. Bag limits in the recreational fishery during this time period (prior to 2001) are generally liberal and ODFW staff recommended that no additional mortality of discarded fish be included prior to 2001.

##### Modern Ocean Boat Landings and Discards (2001 -- 2022)

Recreational landings for ocean boat modes from 2001 -- 2022 are available from RecFIN. Both retained and released estimates of mortality are included, though retained mortality contributes the vast majority to total mortality in years outside the overfished designation for canary rockfish. Release mortality is estimated from angler-reported release rates and the application of discard mortality rates from the PFMC. The average proportion of canary rockfish discarded was averaged 4.5% from 2001 -- 2003 and 2017 -- 2022. During years where canary rockfish retention was prohibited, discard rates increased to 96.1% on average (2004 -- 2016). From 2001 -- 2022, total landings averaged 16.0 mt, ranging from 1.7 to 60.6 mt. In 2022, estimated ocean boat landings were 55.7 mt.

##### Length compositions

Recreational length samples were obtained from two primary sources: \gls{mrfss} and \gls{recfin} (\gls{orbs}). \Gls{odfw} special project sampling data were considered but given the high sample sizes available from standard sampling, these data were not utilized. From 1980 -- 1989 and from 1993 -- 2000, the \gls{mrfss} program collected samples from both ocean and inland (estuary) areas (n = 46,656). \Gls{odfw} provided \gls{mrfss} samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values (n = 7,176). From 1980 -- 1989, total lengths (mm) were collected by \gls{mrfss}, which were converted to fork length. From 1993 -- 2000, fork length (mm) was collected. Length samples from 2001 -- 2022 from the \gls{orbs} sampling program are available on \gls{recfin} (n = 27,135). All \gls{orbs} samples are by fork length (mm). The vast majority (99.4%) of these samples are from ocean trips (n = 26,985). Table X details sample sizes by year and recreational fleet.

#### California

California recreational catch came from \gls{mrfss} (1980-2003) and \gls{recfin} (2005-2022). Because of the transition from \gls{mrfss} to \gls{recfin}, no estimate was available in either database in 2004. \Gls{cdfw} provided a value of 10.59 mt for 2004 [J. Budrick, personal communication, 3/18/23, based on @monk2019gopher]. There were no estimates for either the party/charter (PC) or private/rental (PR) mode from 1990-1992, so total catches were linearly interpolated between 1989 and 1993. No or minimal PC estimates were available from 1993-1995, so we based the PC value on the average ratio of PR to PC modes across all years with \gls{mrfss} data.

##### Recreational data impacted by COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted recreational port sampling in 2020 and 2021. No sampling at all occurred in April-June, 2020. \Gls{cdfw} provided proxy values for these months (M. Parker, CDFW, personal communication). In addition, California recreational total mortality estimates in the "rockfish genus" were inflated due to \gls{crfs} samplers being unable to closely examine catch and identify catch to species. This was a problem for both PR and PC modes in 2020 and primarily for the PC mode in 2021. An effort was made to allocate some of the rockfish genus mortality to other rockfish species for these modes and years. An expected value of rockfish genus mortality in 2020 and 2021 was generated by mode and year according to the average proportion to the total rockfish mortality this category represented in 2018 and 2019, when regulations were consistent with 2020 and 2021. Mortality above this expected value was attributed to the other species also based on proportions each species represented to the total from 2018 and 2019. Calculations were made by year, mode, and district. The shore-based modes were grouped in with the PR mode. Calculations were initially made in numbers of fish because rockfish genus mortality is only recorded this way. Numbers of fish by species were then converted to weight in kilograms based on average weights of fish recorded by the \gls{crfs} program by district in 2019.

### At Sea Hake Fishery

Catches of canary rockfish are monitored aboard the vessel by observers in the At-Sea hake Observer program (ASHOP) and were available for the years of 1975-2014. Observers use a spatial sample design, based on weight, to randomly choose a portion of the haul to sample for species composition. For the last decade, this is typically 30-50% of the total weight. The total weight of the sample is determined by all catch passing over a flow scale. All species other than hake are removed and weighed, by species, on a motion compensated flatbed scale. Observers record the weights of all non-hake species. Non-hake species total weights are expanded in the database by using the proportion of the haul sampled to the total weight of the haul. The catches of non-hake species in unsampled hauls is determined using bycatch rates determined from sampled hauls. Since 2001, more than 97% of the hauls have been observed and sampled.

### Foreign Catches

From the 1960s through the early 1970s, foreign trawling enterprises harvested considerable amounts of rockfish off Washington and Oregon, and along with the domestic trawling fleet, landed large quantities of canary rockfish. Foreign catches of individual species were estimated by Rogers (2003) and attributed to INPFC areas for the years of 1966-1976 for canary rockfish. However, INPFC areas do not coincide with the spatial strata defined in this assessment. INPFC catches were translated to strata in the following manner: catches from the US Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas were designated to the 46-49°N stratum, catches in the Eureka INPFC area were allocated to the 42-46°N stratum, and catches from the Monterey INPFC area were assigned to the 32-42°N stratum.

### Discards

Estimates of dead discards are combined with landed catch when computing the "catches" input into the Stock Synthesis model (Table 8). The ratio of discarded weight to landed weight (here termed the "discard ratio") for the domestic trawl and non-trawl fisheries were assumed at the following values: 1892-1980 using 1% discard ratio, based on the assumption that discard rates were low prior to management actions, due to the high-value nature of the fishery (and in agreement with previous assessments, Stewart 2007), 1981-1994 using a 5% discard ratio, (at approximately the value calculated by J. Wallace using data from (Pikitch et al., 1988), 1995-1999 using a 20% discard ratio, and 2000-2001 using the average discard ratio 2002-2004 for all states combined (i.e., 77% for the trawl, and 210% for the nontrawl). Discard amounts for the domestic trawl, non-trawl, and at-sea hake fisheries from 2002-2013 were calculated from estimates provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program, which estimates dead discards for each fishery and state. The average discard amounts from 2011-2013 was used to calculate the amount of discards in 2014. Discards for the recreational fishery are calculated directly from RecFIN for Oregon and California, and discards in the foreign fishery are assumed to be negligible. Discards for the Washington recreational fishery were estimated directly from number of released fish provided by the state where discard mortality was assumed to 42%, an estimated weighted average based on the death by depth data (PFMC 2014).

### Expansion of length and age-composition samplmes

Twenty-eight bins from 12 to 66 cm were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year, the first bin including all observations less than 12 cm and the last bin including all fish larger than 66 cm. For the length-composition samples from the WCGBTS, these bins are populated with a modest, but consistent degree of sampling: 32-75 tows and 423-1467 fish per year (Table 1). The Triennial survey (Table 2) has a similar number of tows per year (13-95) but considerably larger numbers of fish per year (407-3119). Input sample sizes for length-composition data are calculated using the same formula as was used in the 2007 benchmark assessment. In summary, this method was based on analysis of the input and model-derived effective sample sizes from stock assessments completed in 2005 for west coast groundfish. It makes the input sample size a function of both the number of fish sampled and the number of trips or hauls sampled. A piece-wise linear regression was used to estimate the increase in effective sample size per sample based on fish-per-sample and the maximum effective sample size for large numbers of individual fish:

*INSERT EQUATION HERE*

These values are likely to represent a reasonable starting point that generally reflects the degree of observation error commensurate with sampling a given number of fish from a given number of samples. They were used most recently in the 2013 darkblotched rockfish benchmark assessment (Gertseva and Thorson, 2013).

Age-frequency data from the Triennial and WCGBT surveys were compiled as conditional age-at-length distributions by sex and year. Individual length- and age-observations can be thought of as entries in an age-length key (matrix), with age across the columns and length down the rows. The approach consists of tabulating the sums within rows as the standard length-frequency distribution and, instead of also tabulating the sums to the age margin, instead the distribution of ages in each row of the age-length key is treated as a separate observation, conditioned on the row (length) from which it came. This approach has several benefits for analysis above the standard use of marginal age compositions. First, age structures are generally collected as a subset of the fish that have been measured. If the ages are to be used to create an external age-length key to transform the lengths to ages, then the uncertainty due to sampling and missing data in the key are not included in the resulting age-compositions used in the stock assessment. If the marginal age compositions are used with the length compositions in the assessment, the information content on sex-ratio and year class strength is largely double-counted as the same fish are contributing to likelihood components that are assumed to be independent. Using conditional age-distributions for each length bin allows only the additional information provided by the limited age data (relative to the generally far more numerous length observations) to be captured, without creating a 'double-counting' of the data in the total likelihood. The second major benefit to using conditional age-composition observations is that in addition to being able to estimate the basic growth parameters (L age-1, L age-30, K) inside the assessment model, the distribution of lengths at a given age, usually governed by two parameters; the CV of length at some young age and the CV at a much older age, are also quite reliably estimated. This information could only be derived from marginal age-composition observations where very strong and well-separated cohorts existed, that were quite accurately aged and measured; rare conditions at best. By fully estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model, this major source of uncertainty is included in the assessment results, and bias due to size-based selectivity is avoided. Therefore, to retain objective weighting of the length and age data, and to fully include the uncertainty in growth parameters (and avoid potential bias due to external estimation where size-based selectivity is operating) conditional age at-length compositions were developed for the triennial and WCGBT survey data.

Age distributions included 35 bins from age 1 to age 35, with the last bin including all fish of greater age. Input sample sizes were fixed at the number of unique fish within a given length bin. The age samples consists of approximately one-quarter as many fish, as the samples for length (Table 3 and Table 4). These distributions show a tight range of ages at a given length, and clearly show the growth trajectory of females reaching larger sizes than males for a given age. It is often useful for interpretation to compute the marginal age-compositions, and include these in the assessment model (with the likelihood contribution turned off, so they do not affect model fit in any way) for comparison of the 'implied' fit to the margin of the age-length key. Although these NWFSC age distributions seem to show some diagonal structure, close inspection reveals that it does not track consistently through any of the recent cohorts. This time series is short, and does not encompass the period when substantial reductions in the canary population occurred, and so may be relatively uninformative in the assessment model, except for estimation of growth parameters.
