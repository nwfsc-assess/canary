## Total removals

Removals (1892-20014) for canary rockfish were compiled from multiple data sources.  This assessment includes total removals (landings plus dead discards) by stratum for the following fleets: trawl, non-trawl, recreational, foreign trawl, at-sea hake, and research removals.  A summary of total removals are provided in Table 5, Table 6, and Figure 2.

## Fishery-Dependent Data

Commercial landings of rockfish and the biological characteristics of these landings were not consistently sampled for scientific purposes until the early 1960s (Niska, 1976).  Statewide sampling programs to determine species compositions of the landed catches began in the late 1960s.  The first rigorous monitoring programs that included routine collection of biological data (e.g., sex, age, size, maturity states, etc.) were begun in 1980. Currently, port biologists employed by each state fishery agency (California Department Fish and Game, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife - ODFW, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife - WDFW) collect species-composition information and biological data from the landed catches of commercial trawling vessels that have completed their fishing trips.  The sampling sites are commonly processing facilities located at ports along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington.  The monitoring programs currently in place are generally based on stratified, multistage sampling designs. 

Commercial length-frequency distributions were developed for each fleet for which observations were available, following the same bin structure as was used for research observations.  For each fleet, the raw observations (compiled from the PacFIN) were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained.  These expanded length observations were then combined within years for each fleet.  Age frequencies were computed in the same manner. Sampling statistics for each fleet and year are given in Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, and Table 12, and clearly show the different sampling targets employed over different time periods and between state agencies. 

The weighted length-frequency distributions are shown in Figure 12- Figure 23.  The annual observations were recorded as unidentified sex; both sexes were combined and are treated as such in the model.  By fleet, a number of important patterns are visible in the data.  The trawl fleets for each state, although the data are noisy, appear to show a decline in mean length of the catch from 1978 to 2000 (Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14), with an increase in the mean length for recent years of the landed catch.  The length composition data from the non-trawl fleet are much sparser compared to the trawl fleet making it difficult to discern a pattern in the mean length landed (Figure 15, Figure 16, and Figure 17).  The at-sea hake fishery was comprised of larger lengths relative to the trawl fishery, with the majority of length samples from Washington (Figure 18, Figure 19, and Figure 20).  All three recreational fleets appear to generally target smaller fish relative to the other fleets (Figure 21, Figure 22, and Figure 23).

Marginal commercial age-frequency distributions were compiled and are presented in Figure 24 - Figure 33.  Age composition samples are expanded similarly to the commercial length samples (i.e., first by sample, and then by trip).  We expand age composition samples independently for each state, and also separately for three age determination categories: (1) ages read by using break-and-burn methods by ODFW or CAPS, (2) ages read by break-and-burn methods by WDFW, and (3) ages read using surface methods by any lab.  Age data for California were very sparse (no data between 1986 and 2000), but the majority of observed fish being younger than age 19 in recent years (Figure 24). Age compositions for the Oregon trawl fleet show a clear decline in both males and females older than ~ age 20 from the mid-1980s to recent years (Figure 25).  In Washington, although missing age data from much of the time-series, there are larger proportions of older ages compared to the other two states (Figure 26). Age data for the non-trawl fleet for all states is sparse enough that little pattern can reliably be discerned (Figure 27-Figure 29). Age data from the at-sea hake fishery was available for 2003-2013 and shows little pattern. Washington is the only state with age data from the recreational fleets, and these data show a larger portion of the sample fish being less than 10 years of age (Figure 33). 

In aggregate, the biological data from fishery sources shows no evidence of strong year-classes moving through the population. This could be due to low recruitment variability, noisy data, or both. Further, declines in mean size and age seem to show a latitudinal cline, with more extreme declines to the south, and limited declines observed in Washington and Oregon. 


### Commercial data by State

#### Washington

The historical landings (1935-1965) for Washington were retained from the last full assessment (see Stewart 2007 for additional details).  The landings from 1966-1980 were compiled from three different sources; 1966 from Hongskul (1975), 1967-1969 from Tagart and Kimura (1982), and 1970-1980 from WDFW fish ticket estimates.  

In 1966, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) initiated a sampling program to estimate landings of each rockfish species within these mixed species complexes. Tagart and Kimura (1982) described methodology employed in calculating rockfish landings by species based on data collected by the WDFW sampling program, providing a time series of canary rockfish landings by year between 1967 and 1969.  and Tagart and Kimura (1982) The rockfish landings for 1966 were compiled by Hongskul (1975).  However, no species-specific catches were estimated. To derive estimates of canary rockfish from rockfish landings for 1966, the proportion of canary rockfish in landings from 1967-1969 was estimated from the Tagart and Kimura (1982) data set.  There was no available information for historical non-trawl landing in Washington.  Recent landings (1981-2014) for these two gear types were obtained from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) retrieval dated March 3, 2015, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).

#### Oregon

Historical reconstructed trawl and hook & line landings of canary rockfish from Oregon for the years 1892–1986 were obtained from Vladlena Gertseva (NWFSC, NOAA). A description of the methods can be found in Karnowski et al. (2011). Recent landings (1987-2014) for these two gear types were obtained from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) retrieval dated March 3, 2015, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).

#### California

Historical commercial fishery landings of canary rockfish were obtained from the online database of the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, also known as CALCOM (128.114.3.187) for the years 1916–1980. A description of the methods can be found in Ralston et al. (2010).  Recent landings by trawl and hook & line gear types (1981-2014) were obtained from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) retrieval dated March 3, 2015, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).

### Recreational data by state

Estimates of recreational catch from 1928-2014 were generated through use of the RecFIN information system and also obtained directly from the states.  The RecFIN information system contains data for the years of 1980-2014 with estimates in the early period based on data gathered using Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) sampling protocols. However, in more recent years, estimates for some segments of the recreational fishery have relied primarily on data collection programs administered by the state agencies. The MRFSS procedure has generally been used to estimate effort of recreational fishermen, through use of phone surveys, and species catch composition and CPUE through port sampling of individual trips. Recreational landings were compiled from the following sources by state and time period: Washington, 1967-1986 and 1990-2014 from state sampling program (P. Weyland, personal communication). The Washington recreational catch for the missing three years (1987-1989) were obtained from RecFIN.  Oregon: 1981-1989 and 1993-2013 from RecFIN.  California: Historical estimates from 1928-1979 were obtained from the California historical catch reconstruction available through CALCOM.  Recreational catches for California from 1981-1989 and 1993-2013 were obtained from RecFIN.  Missing data from 1990-1992 were interpolated based on adjacent years for Oregon and California. The removals for 1980 contained in RecFIN were not used due to survey quality problems (Karpov et al. 1995, Cope and Key 2009).  The catch for this year for California and Oregon were estimated by extrapolating between the removals in 1979 and 1981.

Recreational length-frequency distributions were compiled from data available through RecFIN for California and Washington select years, while data were obtained from Oregon (A. Dauble, personal communication) and Washington (P. Weyland, personal communication). Age-frequencies were only available for Washington (P. Weyland, personal communication)

### At Sea Hake Fishery

Catches of canary rockfish are monitored aboard the vessel by observers in the At-Sea hake Observer program (ASHOP) and were available for the years of 1975-2014.  Observers use a spatial sample design, based on weight, to randomly choose a portion of the haul to sample for species composition.  For the last decade, this is typically 30-50% of the total weight.  The total weight of the sample is determined by all catch passing over a flow scale.  All species other than hake are removed and weighed, by species, on a motion compensated flatbed scale.  Observers record the weights of all non-hake species.  Non-hake species total weights are expanded in the database by using the proportion of the haul sampled to the total weight of the haul.  The catches of non-hake species in unsampled hauls is determined using bycatch rates determined from sampled hauls.  Since 2001, more than 97% of the hauls have been observed and sampled.

### Foreign Catches

From the 1960s through the early 1970s, foreign trawling enterprises harvested considerable amounts of rockfish off Washington and Oregon, and along with the domestic trawling fleet, landed large quantities of canary rockfish.  Foreign catches of individual species were estimated by Rogers (2003) and attributed to INPFC areas for the years of 1966-1976 for canary rockfish.  However, INPFC areas do not coincide with the spatial strata defined in this assessment.  INPFC catches were translated to strata in the following manner:  catches from the US Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas were designated to the 46-49°N stratum, catches in the Eureka INPFC area were allocated to the 42-46°N stratum, and catches from the Monterey INPFC area were assigned to the 32-42°N stratum.

### Discards

Estimates of dead discards are combined with landed catch when computing the “catches” input into the Stock Synthesis model (Table 8).  The ratio of discarded weight to landed weight (here termed the “discard ratio”) for the domestic trawl and non-trawl fisheries were assumed at the following values: 1892-1980 using 1% discard ratio, based on the assumption that discard rates were low prior to management actions, due to the high-value nature of the fishery (and in agreement with previous assessments, Stewart 2007), 1981-1994 using a 5% discard ratio, (at approximately the value calculated by J. Wallace using data from (Pikitch et al., 1988), 1995-1999 using a 20% discard ratio, and 2000-2001 using the average discard ratio 2002-2004 for all states combined (i.e., 77% for the trawl, and 210% for the nontrawl).  Discard amounts for the domestic trawl, non-trawl, and at-sea hake fisheries from 2002-2013 were calculated from estimates provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program, which estimates dead discards for each fishery and state.  The average discard amounts from 2011-2013 was used to calculate the amount of discards in 2014.  Discards for the recreational fishery are calculated directly from RecFIN for Oregon and California, and discards in the foreign fishery are assumed to be negligible.  Discards for the Washington recreational fishery were estimated directly from number of released fish provided by the state where discard mortality was assumed to 42%, an estimated weighted average based on the death by depth data (PFMC 2014).

### Expansion of length and age-composition samplmes

Twenty-eight bins from 12 to 66 cm were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year, the first bin including all observations less than 12 cm and the last bin including all fish larger than 66 cm.  For the length-composition samples from the WCGBTS, these bins are populated with a modest, but consistent degree of sampling: 32-75 tows and 423-1467 fish per year (Table 1). The Triennial survey (Table 2) has a similar number of tows per year (13-95) but considerably larger numbers of fish per year (407-3119).  Input sample sizes for length-composition data are calculated using the same formula as was used in the 2007 benchmark assessment.  In summary, this method was based on analysis of the input and model-derived effective sample sizes from stock assessments completed in 2005 for west coast groundfish. It makes the input sample size a function of both the number of fish sampled and the number of trips or hauls sampled. A piece-wise linear regression was used to estimate the increase in effective sample size per sample based on fish-per-sample and the maximum effective sample size for large numbers of individual fish:

*INSERT EQUATION HERE*

These values are likely to represent a reasonable starting point that generally reflects the degree of observation error commensurate with sampling a given number of fish from a given number of samples.  They were used most recently in the 2013 darkblotched rockfish benchmark assessment (Gertseva and Thorson, 2013). 

Age-frequency data from the Triennial and WCGBT surveys were compiled as conditional age-at-length distributions by sex and year. Individual length- and age-observations can be thought of as entries in an age-length key (matrix), with age across the columns and length down the rows. The approach consists of tabulating the sums within rows as the standard length-frequency distribution and, instead of also tabulating the sums to the age margin, instead the distribution of ages in each row of the age-length key is treated as a separate observation, conditioned on the row (length) from which it came. This approach has several benefits for analysis above the standard use of marginal age compositions. First, age structures are generally collected as a subset of the fish that have been measured. If the ages are to be used to create an external age-length key to transform the lengths to ages, then the uncertainty due to sampling and missing data in the key are not included in the resulting age-compositions used in the stock assessment. If the marginal age compositions are used with the length compositions in the assessment, the information content on sex-ratio and year class strength is largely double-counted as the same fish are contributing to likelihood components that are assumed to be independent. Using conditional age-distributions for each length bin allows only the additional information provided by the limited age data (relative to the generally far more numerous length observations) to be captured, without creating a ‘double-counting’ of the data in the total likelihood. The second major benefit to using conditional age-composition observations is that in addition to being able to estimate the basic growth parameters (L age-1, L age-30, K) inside the assessment model, the distribution of lengths at a given age, usually governed by two parameters; the CV of length at some young age and the CV at a much older age, are also quite reliably estimated. This information could only be derived from marginal age-composition observations where very strong and well-separated cohorts existed, that were quite accurately aged and measured; rare conditions at best. By fully estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model, this major source of uncertainty is included in the assessment results, and bias due to size-based selectivity is avoided. Therefore, to retain objective weighting of the length and age data, and to fully include the uncertainty in growth parameters (and avoid potential bias due to external estimation where size-based selectivity is operating) conditional age at-length compositions were developed for the triennial and WCGBT survey data.
 
Age distributions included 35 bins from age 1 to age 35, with the last bin including all fish of greater age. Input sample sizes were fixed at the number of unique fish within a given length bin.  The age samples consists of approximately one-quarter as many fish, as the samples for length (Table 3 and Table 4). These distributions show a tight range of ages at a given length, and clearly show the growth trajectory of females reaching larger sizes than males for a given age. It is often useful for interpretation to compute the marginal age-compositions, and include these in the assessment model (with the likelihood contribution turned off, so they do not affect model fit in any way) for comparison of the ‘implied’ fit to the margin of the age-length key. Although these NWFSC age distributions seem to show some diagonal structure, close inspection reveals that it does not track consistently through any of the recent cohorts. This time series is short, and does not encompass the period when substantial reductions in the canary population occurred, and so may be relatively uninformative in the assessment model, except for estimation of growth parameters.
