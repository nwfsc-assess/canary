# Management

## Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the final year of the model, 2022. Average unfished spawning output is estimated to be `r round(model$SBzero, 0)` million eggs and unfished total summary biomass is estimated to be `r format(model$derived_quants['SmryBio_unfished','Value'], scientific = FALSE, digits = 3)` metric tons. A population at equilibrium at a target of $B_{40\%}$ is associated with a total dead catch of `r round(model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'Value'], 0)` metric tons and spawning output of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], 0)` million eggs. A population at equilibrium at an SPR target of 50% is associated with a total dead catch of `r round(model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 0)` metric tons and spawning output of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 0)` million eggs. A population at equilibrium at model-estimated maximum sustainable yield is associated with a total dead catch of `r round(model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_MSY', 'Value'], 0)` metric tons and spawning output of `r round(model$derived_quants['SSB_MSY', 'Value'], 0)` million eggs. For a full list of reference points at the three different management targets, see Table \ref{tab:ref-pts}. 

The 2022 `r spp` spawning output relative to unfished spawning biomass is within the precautionary zone at `r round(100*model$current_depletion, 1)` percent for 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity (1 âˆ’ SPR) has been low since 2000 but has recently increased to fishing mortality corresponding to an SPR near 0.5 (Figure \ref{fig:spr}). The yield curve indicates current yield is below MSY estimated in the model, but above an optimum yield based on both proxy targets (Figure \ref{fig:yield}).

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

To be completed following the STAR panel.

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The model estimated uncertainty around the `r model$endyr+1` spawning output for `r spp` is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma, 2)`. Each of these are very likely to underestimate overall uncertainty due to the necessity to fix several key population dynamics parameters (e.g., steepness, recruitment variance, natural mortality for males) and because there is no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature; to be complete after the STAR panel).

Although the decision table is to be complete after the STAR panel review, based upon the considerations, explorations, and diagnostics described previously, we conclude that different treatments and assumptions regarding data preparation, data weightings, and decisions around selectivity blocks and mirroring have limited relative impact on estimates of stock status for `r spp` compared to choices around stock productivity. Estimates of stock status are sensitive to assumptions regarding the biological parameters that govern productivity and the yield curve, especially the base natural mortality rate, the assumption that female natural mortality is age-invariant is estimated separately from males, and indirectly that male and female selectivity differs with respect the rate of decline at larger lengths. We therefore recommend that natural mortality formulations form the basis for a decision table, and further understanding on the appropriate forms and values are prioritized as a subject for future research.

## Regional Management Considerations

Regional management differences exist across the U.S. West Coast based on various state-specific management measures. Spatial closures, bag limits, and depth restrictions can influence the effect of fishing on populations of a species that can vary by region. Spatial closures are expected to increase the spatial heterogeneity in abundance and size or age structure of fished stocks. This greater spatial variability can complicate the assumptions made in stock assessment models, particularly the assumption that the densities and demographic structure of assessed populations are relatively homogeneous. Although a wide range of factors above and beyond spatial management measures can also lead to violations of those assumptions, the challenge can be particularly important for longer lived populations with lower movement rates. While spatially explicit assessment models provide a means of more explicitly addressing these challenges, such models are computationally intensive, require robust data from the specific areas being modeled, and may also require detailed information regarding movement and dispersal rates [@mcgilliard_accounting_2015; @berger_space_2017; @cadrin_defining_2020].

The 2015 stock assessment used a spatial population model with spatial connectivity in the apportionment of recruitment, and catches assigned to individual regions. Spatial models can provide regional estimates in spawning output and spawning output relative to unfished levels, although estimates from individual areas within spatial models can be biased even when estimates over the entire area are unbiased [@bosley_mismatch_2022]. Regional estimates of spawning output or relative spawning output were not provided in [@thorson_status_2016]. The text briefly mentions that California had the largest declines in spawning output relative to unfished levels, and the model assumed recruitment was apportioned approximately as 20-50-30 for California, Oregon, and Washington. Ultimately, @thorson_status_2016 argued that a spatial approach was "a tool to visualize and explore model residuals and to be a method to identify time-varying selectivity at the stock-wide level, rather than as a basis for spatially varying fisheries management."

For this assessment, we chose to focus efforts on a coastwide model. The reasons for doing so have been described elsewhere, but briefly were based on principles of parsimony, evidence of concerns around model stability, and the similar overall results between the coastwide and spatial models from @thorson_status_2016, even with low levels of movement among regions. We used an area-as-fleets approach to approximate spatial structure in exploitation, and to capture potential differences in population-structure by region within composition data. Such an approach performs well when the underlying population is uniform, but can be biased when it is not [@bosley_mismatch_2022]. Crucially, matching movement dynamics is more important than matching spatial structure of the population [@bosley_mismatch_2022]. The extent to which `r spp` move remains uncertain, and thus understanding the magnitude of movement would be beneficial to understanding the benefit of various modeling structures for assessing `r spp`. However, limited information from tagging, genetic, and otolith microchemistry analyses indicates relatively high movement rates among areas [@demott1982movement; @budrick2016evolutionary; @gao2013isotopic].

Finally, using total survey biomass for apportioning quota to regions maximizes system yield [@bosley_spatialBRP_2019]. Thus, in lieu of reliable spatially explicit estimates of absolute and relative spawning output, estimates from the \gls{s-wcgbt} can be used to apportion catch across regions, as is already standard for U.S. West Coast assessments. Using model-based indices calculated for each state during the process of bridging from a spatial to coastwide model, over the last five years (2017-2022) 15% of the `r spp` population has inhabited California waters, 36% Oregon, and 49% Washington.

## Research and Data Needs

### Responses to Previous Assessment Research and Data Needs

Recommendations from the 2015 benchmark assessment are below and are summarized for brevity. We provide our response to these and updated research recommendations in the section that follows based on our experience this cycle.

1.  A historical catch reconstruction be initiated with the intent of estimating spatial location of catches. Such a process has been initiated in other regions (e.g., the Northwest Atlantic, M. Pinsky, pers. comm.), and will be important to validate the assumptions that are necessary when developing spatial models.

**Response**: This assessment includes a new reconstruction of `r spp` landings in Oregon within unspecified PacFIN categories from 1987--1999. A formal Washington reconstruction is nearing completion, but was not yet ready for use in this assessment. Some work was begun on separating canary rockfish landings in Oregon into those caught in Oregon and Washington waters while compiling data for this assessment. While logbook information may be sufficient to eventually approximate state of catch, the composition data is much more challenging to separate and could not be done within the time available. A comprehensive approach to account for trawl-caught fish across state boundaries is underway as a result of this analysis. Because this assessment model returned to a coastwide configuration, this recommendation was given lower priority.

2.  We endorse a systematic (rather than ad hoc and species-specific) exploration and analysis of Canadian data sources (length and age-composition, indices of abundance, landings, and discards) for several rockfishes.

**Response:** Progress remains species-specific. However, progress for some groundfish species (sablefish, *Anoplopoma fimbria* and petrale sole, *Eopsetta jordani*) is occurring outside of regular regional stock assessment cycles so that it can be completed in a more intentional and less ad hoc fashion. Canary rockfish has not been prioritized for these activities by NMFS or DFO. We explored Canadian `r spp` landings and estimates of recruitment deviations from an assessment conducted one year prior to this one.

3.  We therefore recommend that future research explore methods to stitch these time series back together (i.e., using covariates and a meta-analytic information regarding the ratio of catchability in the two periods).

**Response:** Changes in the spatial (latitudinal and depth) extent of the triennial survey should not impact `r spp`, which are generally not found in the areas the survey expanded into. Canary rockfish are also not known to undertake seasonal migrations, so the change in timing should similarly not be influential. Therefore, this assessment estimates the triennial index using a single spatial GLMM. Both composition data and catch data are truncated so as not to include areas of survey expansion. The index is entered into the assessment model as two different fleets to maintain the ability to test for sensitivity to combining the periods, but catchability and selectivity are mirrored between these two fleets. Thus, they are treated as a single time series with different age and length composition data weights.

4.  We suggest that basic life history research be highly prioritized for future research.

**Response:** This assessment includes updated data and relationships on growth, condition (weight-length), fecundity, and maturity. A number of studies on canary rockfish life history and population structure have been published since the previous assessment [@budrick2016evolutionary; @keller2018canary; @Brooks_thesis_2021]. Unfortunately, these have not resulted in a better understanding of natural mortality and the apparent loss of older females. This remains a research priority. In absence of better understanding of canary rockfish natural mortality, we use natural mortality rates from a recently updated prior [@hamel2022development].

### Current Research and Data Needs

We list current research recommendations and prioritize them from high to low. Lower priority needs should not not be interpreted as unimportant, but rather lower relative to other priorities listed here.

1.  Continued research into the rationale for skewed sex ratios and empirical studies to estimate natural mortality rates, as well as basic life history research for fecundity and growth. This remains a critical uncertainty for canary rockfish, as well as other species of rockfish along the U.S. West Coast, but one that remains largely unknown. The rate of natural mortality as well as whether and to what extent it increases with age is a major source of uncertainty for this assessment, as it has been for past assessments. Recent evidence suggesting sex ratios are nearer unity may be informative, but further research to understand the mechanism by which this occurs would be beneficial for understand the ability of `r spp` to recover. (High)

2.  The \gls{s-wcgbt} has low encounter rates with `r spp` in part because it has limited access to rocky habitat. We recommend exploration of a non-trawl coast-wide fishery-independent indices. This could mean an expansion of the \gls{s-hkl} into more northern waters, or taking advantage of developments in model-based index standardization to stitch together multiple similar overlapping fishery-independent non-trawl sampling programs that have occurred over smaller spatial and temporal scales than the \gls{s-wcgbt}. This also has the potential to provide biological data in a variety of habitats and across latitudinal gradients which when aged using current best practices can help inform biological parameters that have been suggested by Brooks [-@Brooks_thesis_2021] to occur above the southern range of canary rockfish but were not seen to the same extent in current \gls{s-wcgbt} data. (Medium)

3.  Similar to recommendations 1 and 2, other biological relationships can be updated to better understand dynamics for `r spp`. Few samples of canary rockfish are available to inform estimates of fecundity. Fecundity for canary rockfish was based on a genus level relationship from @dick_meta-analysis_2017. The resulting curve from these two relationships did not greatly differ but did result in changes in the spawning output within the bridging analysis. Greater species-specific information on canary rockfish fecundity would ensure that biological relationships better reflect individual species dynamics should they differ from other species in their genus. (Medium)

4.  This assessment model does not include any ecosystem or climate considerations, but `r spp` are considered highly vulnerable and highly exposed to climate change. To date, most research has relied on non-mechanistic basin-scale indices that may not be reliable predictors of how environmental conditions will impact productivity moving forward. In addition, the lack of correspondence between recruitment deviations estimated in this assessment and in British Columbia is concerning, as recruitment deviations are often used as response variables to understand environmental drivers of productivity. We recommend further research into environmental drivers of canary rockfish productivity to understand how future and past climate change impact both short-term and long-term changes in productivity. Doing this research in a multispecies manner across groundfish species, particularly those with similar life histories, may lead to more statistical power to gain new insight. (Medium)

5.  Further exploration of differences in spatial and non-spatial modeling structure, stability, and results. The structure of `r spp` stock assessments has varied over time. The 2015 assessment added population structure so as to more explicitly describe potential regional differences in depletion. For this assessment we return to a coastwide model for reasons explain previously. Although the 2015 model showed little difference in results between a spatial and coastwide model, which is also supported through bridging analyses both before and after data weighting, balancing spatial explorations of differences in exploitation, movement, or biological patterns with the realities of model complexity and stability within the time frame of production stock assessments is challenging. Given that this issue could apply to other species in addition to `r spp` we suggest the possibility of establishing a process by which research-based assessments can be done to explore these issues, similar to the research track process on the east coast of the U.S. (Medium)

6.  Research to inform understanding of movement rates for a spatial model, as well as improve estimates of natural mortality. Large scale movement patterns for `r spp` are generally unknown. However, even a small number of tagging samples collected intermittently can improve model estimates [@goethel_tagging_2019]. Any method that determines both the extent and direction of movement would be useful; the method need not be limited to tagging. (Low)

7.  Ageing error matrices were not updated from the 2015 assessment. Revision of the ageing error matrices, incorporating the new aged `r spp` data and utilizing new analytical methods are topics for future research. Potential bias in ageing of old `r spp` based on bomb-radiocarbon data (A. Stephens, \gls{nwfsc}, personal communication, May 2023) should also be considered in these analyses. (Low)
