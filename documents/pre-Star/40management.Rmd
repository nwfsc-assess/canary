# Management

## Reference Points

Average unfished spawning output is estimated to be `r model$SBzero` million eggs and unfished total summary biomass is estimated to be `r model$derived_quants['SmryBio_unfished','Value']` metric tons. A population at equilibrium at a target of $B_{40\%}$ is associated with a total dead catch of `r model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_Btgt', 'Value']` metric tons and spawning output of `r model$derived_quants['SSB_Btgt', 'Value']` million eggs. A population at equilibrium at an SPR target of 50% is associated with a total dead catch of `r model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value']` metric tons and spawning output of `r model$derived_quants['SSB_SPR', 'Value']` million eggs.  A population at equilibrium at model-estimated maximum sustainable yield is associated with a total dead catch of `r model$derived_quants['Dead_Catch_MSY', 'Value']` metric tons and spawning output of `r model$derived_quants['SSB_MSY', 'Value']` million eggs. For a full list of reference points at the three different management targets, see Table \ref{tab:ref-pts}. The yield curve indicates current yield is below MSY estimated in the model, but above an optimum yield based on both proxy targets (Figure \ref{fig:yield}).

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The model estimated uncertainty around the `r model$endyr+1` spawning output for `r spp` is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma, 2)`. Each of these are very likely to underestimate overall uncertainty due to the necessity to fix several key population dynamics parameters (e.g., steepness, recruitment variance, natural mortality for males) and also because there is no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature (to be complete after the STAR panel)).

Although the decision table is to be complete after the STAR panel review, based upon the considerations, explorations, and diagnostics described previously, we conclude that different treatments and assumptions regarding data preparation, data weightings, and decisions around selectivity blocks and mirroring have limited relative impact on estimates of stock status for `r spp` compared to choices around stock productivity. Estimates of stock status are sensitive to assumptions regarding biological parameters and structure that govern productivity and the yield curve, especially base natural mortality rate and the assumption that female natural mortality is age-invariant is estimated separately from males, and indirectly that male and female selectivity differs with respect the rate of decline at larger lengths. We therefore recommend that natural mortality formulations form the basis for a decision table, and further understanding on the appropriate forms and values are prioritized as a subject for future research.

## Regional management considerations

Regional management differences exist across the U.S. West Coast based on variable degree of management measures undertaken by each state. Spatial closures, bag limits, and depth restrictions can influence the effect of fishing on populations of a species that can vary by region. Spatial closures are expected to increase the spatial heterogeneity in abundance and size or age structure of fished stocks. This greater spatial variability can complicate the assumptions made in stock assessment models, particularly the assumption that the densities and demographic structure of assessed populations are relatively homogeneous. Although a wide range of factors above and beyond spatial management measures can also lead to violations of those assumptions, and the challenge is intuitively less problematic for populations with high movement rates and/or high population turnover, the challenge can be particularly important for longer lived populations with lower movement rates. While spatially explicit assessment models provide a means of more explicitly addressing these challenges, such models are computationally intensive, require robust data from the specific areas being modeled, and may also require detailed information regarding movement and dispersal rates [@mcgilliard_accounting_2014; @berger_space_2017, @cadrin_defining_2020].

The 2015 stock assessment used a spatial population model with spatial connectivity in the apportionment of recruitment, and catches assigned to individual regions. Spatial models can provide regional estimates in spawning output and spawning output relative to unfished, although estimates from individual areas within spatial models can be biased whereas estimates over the entire area may unbiased [@bosley_mismatch_2022]. Regional estimates of spawning output or relative spawning output were not provided in [@thorson_report_2016], and only briefly mentioned that California had the largest declines in spawning output relative to unfished, and state that recruitment was apportioned approximately as 20-50-30 for California, Oregon, and Washington. Ultimately, [@thorson_report_2016] argued that a spatial apporach was "a tool to visualize and explore model residuals and to be a method to identify time-varying selectivity at the stock-wide level, rather than as a basis for spatially varying fisheries management". 

For this assessment, we chose to focus efforts on a coastwide model. The reasons for doing so have been described elsewhere, but briefly were based on principles of parsimony, evidence of concerns around model stability, and that similar overall results between the coastwide and spatial models from [@thorson_report_2016] even with low levels of movement among regions. We used an area-as-fleets approach to approximate spatial structure in exploitation, and to capture potential differences in population-structure by region within composition data. [@bosley_mismatch_2022] found that such an approach performed well when the underlying population was uniform, but can be biased when it is not. A key finding from [@bosley_mismatch_2022] was that matching movement dynamics was more important than matching spatial structure of the population. The extent to which `r spp` move remains uncertain, and thus understanding the magnitude of movement would be beneficial to understanding the benefit of various modeling structures for assessing `r spp`.

[@bosley_spatialBRP_2019] found that using total survey biomass for apportioning quota to regions maximized system yield. Thus, in lieu of spatially explicit estimates of absolute and relative spawning output, estimates from the \gls{s-wcgbt} can be used to apportion catch across regions, as is already standard for U.S. West Coast assessments. 

**Do we need to provide regional estimates from the survey?**

## Research and Data Needs

### Responses to previous assessment research and data needs

Recommendations from the 2015 benchmark assessement are below and are summarized for brevity. We provide our response to these and updated research recommendations in the section that follows based on our experience this cycle. 

1.  A historical catch reconstruction be initiated with the intent of estimating spatial location of catches. Such a process has been initiated in other regions (e.g., the Northwest Atlantic, M. Pinsky, pers. comm.), and will be important to validate the assumptions that are necessary when developing spatial models.

**Response**: This assessment includes a new reconstruction of `r spp` landings in Oregon within unspecified PacFIN categories from 1987-1999. A formal Washington reconstruction is nearing completion, but was not yet ready for use in this assessment. Some work was begun on separating canary rockfish landings in Oregon into those caught in Oregon and Washington waters while compiling data for this assessment. While logbook information may be sufficient to eventually approximate state of catch, the composition data is much more challenging to separate and could not be done within the time available. A comprehensive approach to account for trawl-caught fish across state boundaries is underway as a result of this analysis. Because this assessment model returned to a coast-wide configuration, this recommendation was given lower priority.

2.  We endorse a systematic (rather than ad hoc and species-specific) exploration and analysis of Canadian data sources (length and age-composition, indices of abundance, landings, and discards) for several rockfishes.

**Response:** Progress remains species-specific. However, progress for some groundfish species (sablefish, petrale sole) is occurring outside of regular stock assessment cycles so that it can be completed in a more intentional and less ad hoc fashion. Canary rockfish has not been prioritized for these activities by NMFS or DFO. We explored Canadian `r spp` landings and estimates of recruitment deviations from an assessment conducted one year prior to this one.

3.  We therefore recommend that future research explore methods to stitch these time series back together (i.e., using covariates and a meta-analytic information regarding the ratio of catchability in the two periods).

**Response:** Changes in the spatial (latitudinal and depth) extent of the triennial survey should not impact `r spp`, which are generally not found in the areas the survey expanded into. Canary rockfish are also not known to undertake seasonal migrations, so the change in timing should similarly not be influential. Therefore, this assessment estimates the triennial index using a single spatial GLMM. Both composition data and catch data are truncated so as not to include areas of survey expansion. The index is entered into the assessment model as two different fleets to maintain the ability to test for sensitivity to combining the periods, but catchability and selectivity are mirrored between these two fleets. Thus, they are treated as a single time series with different age and length composition data weights. 

4.  We suggest that basic life history research be highly prioritized for future research.

**Response:** This assessment includes updated data and relationships on growth, condition (weight-length), fecundity, and maturity. A number of studies on canary rockfish life history and population structure have been published since the previous assessment [@budrick2016evolutionary; @keller2018canary; @Brooks_thesis_2021]. Unfortunately, these have not resulted in a better understanding of natural mortality and the apparent loss of older females. This remains a research priority. In absence of better understanding of canary rockfish natural mortality, we use natural mortality rates from a recently updated prior [@hamel2022development]. These have also not clearly identified consistent patterns in latitudinal differences in growth. We also recommend efforts towards this work for continued research.

### Current research and data needs

**TO DO: Need to add fecundity and growth parameter section. Kiva can you do growth?**

1. Continued research into the rationale for skewed sex ratios and empirical studies to estimate naturalm mortality rates. 

1.  The \gls{s-wcgbt} has low encounter rates with `r spp` in part because it has limited access to rocky habitat. We recommend exploration of a non-trawl coast-wide fishery-independent indices. This could mean an expansion of the \gls{s-hkl} into more northern waters, or taking advantage of developments in model-based index standardization to stitch together multiple similar overlapping fishery-independent non-trawl sampling programs that have occurred over smaller spatial and temporal scales than the \gls{s-wcgbt}. This also has the potential to provide biological data in a variety of habitats and across latitudinal gradients which when aged using current best practices can help inform biological parameters that have been suggested by Brooks [-@Brooks_thesis_2021] to occur above the southern range of canary rockfish but were not seen to the same extent in current \gls{s-wcgbt} data. 

2. Growth parameters to ascertain whether biological relationship differ along the coast

3. Fecundity for canary

4. Further exploration of differences in spatial and non-spatial modeling structure, stability, and results. The structure of `r spp` stock assessments has varied over time. The 2015 assessment added population structure so as to more explicitly describe potential regional differences in depletion. For this assessment we return to a coastwide model for reasons explain previously. Although the 2015 model shows little difference in results between a spatial and coastwide model, which is also supported through bridging analyses both before and after data weighting, balancing spatial explorations of differences in exploitation, movement, or biological patterns with the realities of model complexity and stability within the timeframe of production stock assessments is challenging. Given that this issue could apply to species other than `r spp` we suggest the possibility of establishing a process by which research-based assessments can be done to explore these issues, similar to what the U.S. east employs with research-track assessments. 

5. Exploration of spatial models, as well as greater understanding of natural mortality would benefit from tagging studies to inform movement as well as potential inform natural mortality rates. Tagging studies are expensive, and large scale movement patterns for `r spp` are generally unknown, however [@goethel_tagging_2019] found that even few samples collected intermittently can improve model estimates. As recommended in past assessments for `r spp` tagging studies would be informative.
