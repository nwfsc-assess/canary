title: Status of Canary Rockfish (_Sebastes pinniger_) along the U.S. West coast in
  2023.

<!--chapter:end:00title.Rmd-->

# Introduction

## Basic Information

Canary rockfish (*Sebastes pinniger*) are distributed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the western Gulf of Alaska to northern Baja California; however, the species is most abundant from British Columbia to central California [@miller1972guide; @hart1973pacific; @love2002rockfishes]. Adults are primarily found along the continental shelf shallower than 300 m, although they are occasionally observed in deeper waters. Juvenile canary rockfish are found in shallow and intertidal areas [@love2002rockfishes].

From 2001 to 2011, the canary rockfish stock assessment models structured the population as a single coastwide stock, but used an areas-as-fleets approach to account for spatial differences in fishing along the coast. The most recent assessment instead modeled three demographically distinct areas along the coast, but assumed fishery selectivity was constant across latitudes [@thorson_status_2015]. Research since the previous assessment indicates that canary rockfish are genetically well-mixed along the U.S. west coast [@budrick2016evolutionary], and that the previous assessment model had poor numerical stability and the spatially explicit parameters that the model attempted to estimate were not in fact identifiable [@monnahan2019overcoming]. In addition, **[Brian cites some spatial stock assessment literature]**. Thus, this assessment model returns to the historical single-area (coastwide) model with fishery selectivity generally estimated by state (Figure \@ref{fig:map}).

**From previous assessment delete?** treats the U.S. canary rockfish resource from the Mexican border to the Canadian border as a single coast-wide stock. However, unlike past assessments, the model explicitly tracks differences in age-structure and stock status in each of three spatial strata, divided by the 42°N and 46°N parallels, and informally referred to as CA (32-42°N), OR (42-46°N), and WA (46-49°N). The model tracks spatial differences in demographics because previous research indicates that spatial differences in exploitation rates or history can result in time-varying selectivity when analyzed using a nonspatial model [@sampson2011spatial], and because the common "areas-as-fleets" approach is not likely to account for differences in exploitation history in many cases [@cope2011reconciling].

## Life History

Canary rockfish are a medium to large-bodied rockfish; achieving a maximum size of around 70 cm. Female canary rockfish reach larger sizes than males. Canary rockfish are relatively long-lived, with a maximum observed age in the literature of 84 years. However, in both the California Current and the coastal waters off British Columbia, only males are commonly observed above the age of 50, while females tend to be rare above age 30. The degree to which this pattern reflects behavioral differences translating to reduced availability to fishery and survey fishing gear, or an increase in relative mortality for older females has been the focus of much discussion and remains unclear. A similar pattern has been observed for yellowtail rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*) and black rockfish (*Sebastes melanops*), two closely related species [@wallace2004yellowtail; @cope_assessments_2016]. Since the 2002 assessment, this pattern has been accommodated within the stock assessment model by allowing female natural mortality to increase at approximately the age of first sexual maturity. Benchmark and update assessments starting in 2002 have included an increased rate of female natural mortality post-maturity, as justified by an increase in behavioral risk or physiological stress resulting from female spawning.

Adult canary rockfish primarily inhabit areas in and around rocky habitat. They form very dense schools, leading to an extremely patchy population distribution that is reflected in both fishery and survey encounter rates. This distribution strongly affects the calculation and interpretation of population indices and age- or size-composition data. In particular, a patchy spatial distribution, combined with a low rate of encounter, results in an estimated index of abundance that has large estimation intervals and is relatively uninformative about trends in population abundance. Juvenile canary rockfish are found in shallow and intertidal areas [@love2002rockfishes]. Canary rockfish spawn in the winter, producing pelagic larvae and juveniles that remain in the upper water column for 3-4 months [@love2002rockfishes]. These juveniles settle in shallow water around nearshore rocky reefs, where they may congregate for up to three years [@sampson1996canary; @boehlert1984variability] before moving into deeper water. The mean size of individuals captured in the trawl survey shows a characteristic ontogenetic shift to deeper water with increasing body size. In addition, the age and size of canary rockfish appears to vary by latitude, with the oldest largest fish occurring in more northerly latitudes and declining southward along the coast, with some evidence that size may increase again in central California [@keller2018canary; @Brooks_thesis_2021].

The most recent research indicates limited stock structure of `r spp` along the U.S. west coast. Limited tagging research conducted off Oregon found that of 10 canary rockfish recovered, 4 moved over 25 km, and 3 moved more than 100 km over a period of several years [@demott1982movement]. A single canary from that study moved 326 km to the south, and those that moved the farthest also moved to much greater depths than the shallow reefs at which they had been tagged. Early genetic research found patterns suggestive of some population structuring between the northern California/southern Oregon and northern Oregon/southern Washington, but this work was based on limited sampling and also found evidence of reduced gene flow between shallow and deeper areas [@wishard1980stock]. Using modern population genetic methods [@gomez2003microsatellite], Budrick [-@budrick2016evolutionary] found little support for population structure of canary rockfish within the California Current .

There are few biogeographic boundaries clearly applicable to rockfish on the U.S. and Canadian west coasts. However, canary rockfish are not found in large numbers south of Point Conception. The divergence zone at the northern edge of Vancouver Island likely creates a barrier for pelagic dispersal and productivity for many species [@ware1989fisheries]; therefore it is the southern portion of the B.C. canary resource that is most likely to have dynamics linked to the U.S. resource. It is likely that canary rockfish cross the U.S. Canadian border as pelagic larvae, juveniles, and possibly adults making their ontogenetic shift to deeper water or moving between areas of rocky habitat.

The 2002 assessment integrated what had previously been separate north-south assessments based on the observations of highest density occurring near headlands and \gls{inpfc} boundaries commonly used to delineate management and assessment areas [@methot2002canary]. They reasoned that splitting stocks or assessments at any \gls{inpfc} boundaries would divide high-density areas that most likely are biologically linked. This logic was followed in the 2005 benchmark assessment and subsequent 2007 and 2009 update assessments, separating fishing fleets geographically to account for potential spatial patterns while retaining a coast-wide assessment area. All U.S. assessments have used the U.S.-Canadian border as the northern boundary for the stock, although the basis for this choice appears to be largely based on both (1) consistency with current management needs, and (2) data availability and feasibility of expanding data from multiple jurisdictions within a single stock assessment.

## Ecosystem Considerations

Canary rockfish are reported to have a diverse diet. Pelagic juveniles consume copepods, amphipods and krill, while adults consume krill and many species of small fish [@love2002rockfishes]. The California Current Trophic Database includes records of canary rockfish consuming amphipods, copepods, euphausiids, isopods, mysids, pandalid shrimp, myctophids, herring, and chaetognaths, as well as unidentified bony fish and crustaceans [@bizzarro_etal_2023]. The degree to which variability in food supply may affect body condition, spawning success or annual growth is unknown. Canary rockfish are a medium to large-bodied rockfish that achieve a maximum size of around 70 cm. Female canary rockfish reach larger sizes than males. Canary rockfish have been reported in stomachs of chinook and coho salmon [@bizzarro_etal_2023]. According to a recent California Current climate vulnerability analysis that ranked species on a scale of low, moderate, high, and very high, canary rockfish have high exposure and high sensitivity to climate change, similar to most rockfish [@mcclure2023vulnerability].

Although ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, there are several important aspects of the recent California current ecosystem that appear to warrant consideration. Lingcod, a potentially important predator of small canary, have rebuilt over the last two decades [@johnson2021lingcod_s; @taylor2021lingcod_n]. To the extent that the component of natural mortality of canary rockfish added by predation from lingcod and other predators has been increasing over recent years, recruitment may be underestimated. This effect could also lead to longer than predicted rebuilding times for canary rockfish [@oken2016evaluating]. Conversely, Pacific salmon are known to consume canary rockfish, and their populations have generally declined in recent years [@bizzarro_etal_2023]. Canary rockfish productivity as estimated in the last assessment is significantly associated with the \gls{pdo} [@mantua_pacific_1997; @bell2023changes], and growth and condition were also found to be associated with the \gls{pdo} and other basin-scale indices [@keller2018canary]. However, relationships between productivity of fish populations with non-mechanistic basin-scale indicators such as the \gls{pdo} have been degrading in recent years due to climate change [@litzow2020changing; @werb2023remarkable], so these relationships may not be reliable predictors moving forward. In contrast to predictions from the climate vulnerability analysis, there is evidence that canary rockfish productivity has been trending upward recently [@bell2023changes]. The prevalence of a strong 1999 year-class for many west coast groundfish species suggest that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life-history strategies [@stachura2014linking; @thorson2013using]. Much research is currently underway to explore these phenomena, and it appears likely that more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes and influences may be able to be incorporated into management both within and outside of future canary rockfish stock assessments.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information

The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast developed first off California late in the 19th century and was catching an average of almost 2,500 metric tons per year over the period 1916-1940 (with an increase in catches in 1916, during World War I). To the north, the rockfish fishery developed slowly and became established during the early 1940s, when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortages of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein [@alverson1964study; @harry_history_1961]. Rockfish catches dropped somewhat following the war, and were generally stable from the 1950s to the 1960s.

Historically, the vast majority of canary rockfish off the U.S. Pacific coast have been harvested by commercial trawling vessels, followed by hook-and-line (primarily vertical longline), shrimp trawls, and various miscellaneous gears (e.g., nets and pots). In 1977, when the \gls{msfcma} was enacted, the large foreign-dominated rockfish fishery that had developed since the late 1960s had its catches eliminated, and the domestic trawl fishery subsequently increased its catches. Canary rockfish were also sought by recreational anglers and considered to be a moderately important species caught in the private vessel and charter boat fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and northern California.

Inspection of the historical catch reconstruction for canary rockfish (REFERENCE) shows that reconstructed catches from 1892 to 2022 were highest historically in the trawl and foreign fisheries (Figure \ref{fig:catches}). The trawl fishery was high around the end of WWII (1945: 3,724 mt), but decreased during the 1950s-1960s. A foreign fleet operated 1966-1976, and nearly exceeded the domestic trawl landings in 1966 (TWL: 1,658 mt, FOR: 1,599 mt). The foreign fleet was replaced by the domestic bottom trawl fleet following the \gls{msfcma} (1978 TWL: 3,945 mt). The trawl fishery reached a peak in the early 1980s (1982: 5,155 mt) and subsequently decreased after the establishment of strict management restrictions starting in the mid-1990s. The decrease in the trawl fishery allowed the recreational and non-trawl fisheries to take a larger proportion of total catch beginning in the 2000s. Following the removal of the overfished designation [@thorson_status_2015], catches increased considerably, though to levels well below those seen during much of the period of industrial fishing. Today, most catch still occurs in the trawl fishery (particularly in a growing midwater trawl fleet), though there is a sizable recreational component of landings as well (2022 TWL: 507 mt, REC: 152 mt). Trawl catches are highest in Oregon, whereas non-trawl and recreational catches are highest in California.

## Summary of Management History and Performance

The first regulations established on the canary rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast were implemented in 1983 as trip limits (40,000 lb. per trip) on the entire Sebastes complex (a market category that at the time included all rockfish species except Pacific Ocean perch and widow rockfish) harvested from the U.S. Vancouver and Columbia \gls{inpfc} areas [@pfmc2002status]. Commercial vessels were not required to separate most rockfish catches into individual species, but rather, only into mixed-species categories, such as the Sebastes complex. Port biologists in each state routinely sample market categories (e.g., Sebastes complex) to determine the actual species composition of these mixed-species categories. Since 1967, various port sampling programs have been utilized by state and federal marine fishery agencies to determine the species compositions of the commercial groundfish landings off the U.S. Pacific coast [@sampson_commercial_1997]. Stratified, multistage sampling designs are currently used in the port sampling programs for purposes of evaluating the species compositions of the total landings, as well as for obtaining biological data on individual species [@crone_sampling_1995; @sampson_commercial_1997].

From 1983 through 1994, canary rockfish were monitored as part of the Sebastes complex, with various trip limits imposed over this 10-year span. In 1993 and 1994, commercial fishermen communicated that fewer canary rockfish were being caught in their rockfish tows [@pfmc2002status]. The 1994 canary rockfish stock assessment [@sampson1994canary] confirmed that the observed declines in the field were likely the result of a population that had not responded favorably to recent levels of fishing pressure and further recommended that the canary rockfish \gls{abc} be reduced to allow the stock to recover. Beginning in 1995, the \gls{abc} for canary rockfish was reduced nearly 60%, to 1,250 mt. In 1995, trip limits specific to canary rockfish (cumulative monthly trip limit of 6,000 lb.) were imposed and commercial vessels were required to sort canary rockfish from other rockfishes. In 1998, catches of canary rockfish were regulated using a two-month cumulative trip limit of 40,000 lb. for the Sebastes complex, of which, no more than 15,000 lb. (38%) could be composed of canary rockfish, i.e., although this species was allocated its own market category, it was still being managed as part of the mixed-species complex. The \gls{abc} was further reduced to 1,045 mt.

The two stock assessments conducted in 1999 (California and Washington-Oregon) found the stock to be depleted and an overfished determination was made in 2000. Subsequently, commercial and recreational fishing opportunities were severely restricted and removals were mainly from bycatch. Canary rockfish became a limiting species for fisheries that target other commercially important species on the continental shelf. The \gls{oy} in 2003 was 44 mt; which was only about 1% of the peak annual catches in the early 1980s. Management regulations were sufficiently strict to keep the catch that year to only 51 mt. During the overfished time period, the fishery was far below \gls{abc} levels. Shelf rockfish species (including canary) could no longer be retained by vessels using bottom trawl footropes with a diameter of greater than 8 inches. The use of small-footrope gear increases the risk of gear loss in rocky areas, and this restriction was intended to discourage trawlers from fishing in high-relief, rocky habitat. The impact of the change in gear regulations was reinforced through reductions in landing limits for all other shelf rockfish species.

*TODO: Thin this, update with current RCA status* In 2002, the trawl and non-trawl \glspl{rca} were implemented as depth-based closed areas to reduce bycatch of overfished rockfish species such as canary in the northern portion of the coast and Boccaccio rockfish in the south. Specific boundaries for the trawl \gls{rca} have varied across bimonthly periods within and among years in response to changing discard rates and fishery dynamics. In 2003, the shoreward boundary of the \gls{rca}ranged from the shoreline to 100 fm. (183 m), and the seaward boundary from 200 to 250 fm. (366-457 m). Small-footrope gear was required shoreward of the \gls{rca} when these areas were open, and retention of canary rockfish was limited to 100 to 300 lbs. per month for the limited entry trawl fisheries north and south of 40º10'. Retention of canary rockfish was prohibited in the limited entry fixed gear fishery. In 2004, the shoreward boundary of the \gls{rca} ranged from the shoreline to 75 fm. and the seaward boundary from 150 to 250 fm. (274-457 m). This dynamic pattern of the closed area extending from the shoreline (or 75 fm.) out to 150 fm. (274 m), 200 fm. (366 m) or 250 fm. (457 m) has continued through 2015. Deeper depths are generally closed in the winter months and there are a number of latitudinal differences in the extent of the current \gls{rca}, however the large majority of depths deeper than 75 fm. (137 m) where canary rockfish occur are now closed to all commercial on-bottom fishing for groundfish. It is possible that by closing most of the depth range of the species the RCA has influenced the size range of canary rockfish available to the fishery. Smaller canary rockfish are available to the commercial fishery when the shoreward boundary is set at 137 m, while some of the larger fish may occur in the closed area. Juvenile canary rockfish are also available to the nearshore commercial and recreational fisheries.

Beginning in 2005, the modified "flatfish" trawl gear was required shoreward of the RCA. This gear was found to reduce the catch-per-unit-effort of canary rockfish relative to standard commercial gear in pilot experiments [@king_protecting_2004]. Recreational limits were also substantially reduced for more than a decade. After first reducing bag limits, starting in 2003 all three states allowed no retention of canary rockfish during recreational fishing. Mortality associated with this fishery is now comprised of discard mortality from fish that are caught while targeting other species such as Pacific halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*) or other rockfish.

A groundfish trawl rationalization program was commenced in 2010 via Amendment 20 to the Groundfish Fisheries Management Plan. Under this program, groundfish limited entry trawl vessels making shoreside deliveries are managed primarily through a system of \glspl{itq}. Trawl permit holders were provided with quota share percentages of the allowable catch of major species and assemblages, based on historical fishery participation. After \glspl{acl} are set for species for a given year, the shares are used to calculate individual quotas (in weight) that represent the amount of species' catch the permitted individual (and associated vessel) are entitled to catch. Unlike previous management, which relied on limiting the landings of vessels, the new system holds individual vessels responsible for retained and discarded catch. Discard amounts are verified by 100% at-sea observation of participating vessels. Vessel accountability for discards has generally led to a reduction in fleet discards since implementation for Pacific rockfishes as a whole. A system for tracking quota balances was also created, and vessels are not allowed to fish when they have negative balances for any species/assemblage. Quota pounds have been transferable between permit holders since the program's beginning, and now the shares of most species may be sold. Accumulation of shares or pounds is subject to accumulation and usage caps. Additionally, the program provided the opportunity for trawl pounds to be fished with other gears on qualified vessels ("gear switching").

Catch accountability for motherships and associated catcher-vessels in the mothership sector for Pacific hake was achieved through a system of regulated cooperatives. Pacific hake catcher-processors operated for years as a voluntary cooperative, and that arrangement was formalized by provisions of Amendment 20. Cooperatives in both of these sectors received annual poundage allocations of hake and non-hake species, based on the entitlements of cooperative members, and these amounts are not transferable between cooperatives. There is also no provision for voluntary transfers of pounds or shares between fishery sectors. Beginning in 2020, the separate allocations for catcher-processors and motherships were combined into a single at-sea whiting set-aside.

Canary rockfish was declared rebuilt following the 2015 stock assessment [@thorson_status_2015]. As a result, in 2017 the ACL increased more than tenfold from 125 mt to 1714 mt (Table \ref{tab:acls}). Catches increased substantially following this relaxation, especially in the recreational fishery and in a growing midwater trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:catches}). Since rebuilding, total mortality (catches plus dead discards) has generally been around 40% of the ACL.

## Foreign and Alaska Fisheries

Canary rockfish in Canadian waters off the coast of British Columbia appear to have similar life history characteristics to those found off the U.S. West Coast. Like the U.S. West Coast, male age samples display a long tail past 60, but there are few females older than 40 [@dfo2023canary]. A 2022 assessment successfully estimated both male and female natural mortality (constant across ages) as 0.065 and 0.093 yr$^{-1}$, respectively [@dfo2023canary]. The canary rockfish population in Canadian waters reached a similar trough around 2000 to that observed in the U.S., but never reached the same low depletion levels [@dfo2023canary]. Removals are dominated by the trawl fishery and by catches off the West Coast of Vancouver Island [areas 3C and 3D; @dfo2023canary]. Catches were highest (>1200 mt) in the decade from 1986-1995, and then declined and have remained relatively stable since, averaging around 800 mt since 1996, and around 540 mt during that time for the West Coast of Vancouver Island [@dfo2023canary].

It is difficult to conclude what the current status of canary rockfish is off of Alaska. The \gls{npfmc} assesses and manages canary rockfish as a minor part of an assemblage including seven species of demersal shelf rockfishes [@joy2022assessment]. The primary component of this group is yelloweye rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*), although quillback (*Sebastes maliger*), copper (*Sebastes caurinus*), China (*Sebastes nebulosus*), tiger (*Sebastes nigrocinctus*) and rosethorn (*Sebastes helvomaculatus*) are also included. No species in the assemblage are the target of a commercial fishery. Yelloweye rockfish biomass is estimated from an autoregressive random effects model applied to submersible biomass estimates (crewed 1994-2009, and remotely operated 2012-2022) and the \gls{iphc} longline survey [@joy2022assessment]. A bayesian state-space surplus production model that incorporated catches was also recently presented as a research model. Canary rockfish, in particular, is managed as Tier 6, and no direct indices of canary abundance in the Gulf of Alaska have been reported.

# Data

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models. The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors. These factors often include, but are not limited to, the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency); the spatial and temporal coverage of the data; the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit; the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance; limitations imposed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Terms of Reference; and the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model. Attributes associated with a data source can change through time, as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes). Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for `r spp`. Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current assessment model. Descriptions of each data source included in the model and sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. In some cases, the inclusion of excluded data sources were explored through sensitivity analyses (see Section \@ref(assessment-model)).

## Data sources used in this assessment

This assessment uses data from the following sources, updating the data that were used in the 2015 benchmark assessment and the corrections to catch applied for the 2017 catch only update, as well as utilizing additional data that were collected since the last benchmark. Fishery data sources (including length composition, age composition, and catch time series) are split among three strata to make comparisons to and explorations from the 2015 benchmark assessment more direct, whereas abundance indices and corresponding length and age compositions from the fishery-independent surveys are combined across these strata to match the population scale reflected in the model. Each data source is summarized here, and then discussed in more detail below:

1.  Data regarding total removals of canary rockfish, from all fisheries and surveys, are compiled for years 1892-2022. These data are obtained from several sources:

a.  In California, landed recreational (1928--2022) and commercial (1916--2022) catches along with estimates of recreational dead discards come from multiple data sources including state reconstructions, \gls{calcom}, \gls{recfin}, and \gls{pacfin}. Historical recreational landings up to 1980 are based on those used in the previous benchmark assessment.
b.  In Oregon, landed recreational and commercial (1892--2022) catches along with estimates of recreational dead discards were provided directly by \gls{odfw} and come from multiple data sources including state reconstructions, \gls{pacfin}, and \gls{recfin}.
c.  In Washington, landed recreational catches (1967--2022) along with estimates of recreational releases were provided directly by \gls{wdfw}. Historical commercial landed catches (1935--1980) are based on those used in the previous assessment. Commercial landed catches from 1981--2022 are from \gls{pacfin}.
d.  Foreign trawl fleet catches from 1966--1976 are based on [@rogers_species_2003].
e.  Total removals of canary in the at sea hake fishery (1973--2022) were provided by the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{ashop}. 
f.  Total commercial discards for recent years (2003--2021) are estimated in the annual mortality report using data from a variety of sources including the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program, and are publicly available: <https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2022/08/g-1-b-nwfsc-report-1-estimated-discard-and-catch-of-groundfish-species-in-the-2021-west-coast-fisheries.pdf/>. 
g.  Discard rates for 1981-1994 are obtained from the Pikitch study as analyzed by J. Wallace.

2.  Fishery-independent data are included from three different surveys:

<!-- -->

a.  The \gls{s-tri} conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center provides abundance index, length composition, and age-composition samples and was included for years 1980-2001.
b.  The \gls{s-wcgbt} conducted by the \gls{nwfsc} provides abundance index, length composition, and age-composition samples, and was available for years 2003-2022, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
c.  The pre-recruit survey, which combines data collected by the \gls{swfsc}, \gls{nwfsc}, and Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative provides a relative index of density for pre-recruit fish, and was included for most years from 2001-2022. Composition data are not used for this survey. 

<!-- -->

3.  Fishery-dependent composition data are included from the following sources:

<!-- -->

a.  Commercial length and age composition data were obtained from \gls{pacfin}.
b.  Recreational length and age composition data from state sampling programs or historical sampling efforts were either provided by the state agencies or were obtained from \gls{recfin}.
c.  Length and age data for canary rockfish from the at-sea hake fishery were obtained from the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{ashop}.

<!-- -->

4.  Estimates of life history parameters are generated from various sources, and include:

## Total removals

Removals (1892-2022) for canary rockfish were compiled from multiple data sources. This assessment includes total removals (landings plus dead discards) by state for the following fleets: trawl, non-trawl, recreational, foreign trawl, and at-sea hake. A summary of total removals are provided in Table \@ref{tab:catches1} and Table \@ref{tag:catches2}, and Figure \ref{fig:catches}.

*Need to update table 5, 6*

### Commercial landings by State

#### Washington

Commercial landings data in Washington were available from 1935--2022. Historical landings (1935--1980) were retained from the last full assessment where they were assumed to be for trawl gears [see @stewart2007canary and @thorson_status_2015 for additional details]. Recent landings (1981--2022) for the trawl and non-trawl (mainly hook and line) gears were obtained from \gls{pacfin}, the central repository for West coast commercial landings (extracted on 03/23/2023, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org). A small update to 2022 landings from \gls{pacfin} values was provided by \gls{wdfw} on 06/18/2023.

#### Oregon

Commercial landings data in Oregon were available from 1892--2022. Historical landings from 1892 to 1986 were provided by \gls{odfw} [@karnowski_historical_2014]. Landings in 1987--1999 were compiled from a combination of \gls{pacfin}, (extracted on 03/23/2023), and a separate \gls{odfw} reconstruction that delineated canary rockfish-specific landings among unspecified species categories within \gls{pacfin} [e.g. URCK and POP1, @odfw2017informational]. Canary rockfish landings from this reconstruction were substituted for the URCK and POP1 landings available from \gls{pacfin} and added to \gls{pacfin} landings from other categories for a complete time series of canary rockfish during this time period. Commercial landings in 2000--2022 were available on \gls{pacfin} (extracted on 03/23/2023).

#### California

Commercial landings data in California were available from 1916--2022. Historical landings from 1916 to 1980 were obtained following the process described in the southern California vermilion rockfish (*Sebastes miniatus*) assessment [see @dick2021vermillion for complete details]. Briefly, landings 1916--1968 came from a state reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings from unknown gears in known regions were allocated proportional to landings from known gears within the same region for each year. Landings from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gears were allocated proportional to the landings from known gears across all known locations for each year. Landings from 1969--1980 came from \gls{calcom}, which for 1969--1977 incorporates fish ticket data including mixed species categories for rockfish that were assigned to individual species using the earliest species composition samples (from the late 1970s and ealy 1980s). Recent (1981--2022) landings by trawl and non-trawl gears were obtained from \gls{pacfin} (extracted on 03/23/2023).

Additional catches caught off the coast of Oregon or Washington but landed in California from 1948-1968 were included, as these were not incorporated within the [@ralston_documentation_2010] reconstruction (E. Dick, personal communication, 3/16/23). These final landings are in the California landings history for consistency with treatment for other states, because historical catches landed in Oregon or Washington but caught in the other state's waters are similarly attributed to the state where they were landed. 

### Commercial Discards

*TO DO: Produce table 8*

Estimates of dead discards were combined with landed catch to provide estimates of total removals that were used as input catches within the Stock Synthesis model (Table 8). In recent years (2000--2022), estimates of dead discards were calculated from discard data, but in earlier years (before 2000), estimates of dead discards were calculated based on assumed discard ratios. 

The ratio of discarded weight to landed weight (here termed the "discard ratio") for the domestic trawl and non-trawl fisheries was assumed at the following values: 1% discard ratio for 1892--1980, based on the assumption that discard rates were low prior to management actions due to the high-value nature of the fishery [and consistent with the previous assessment, @thorson_status_2015]; 5% discard ratio for 1981--1994 which is approximately the value calculated by J. Wallace, NMFS using data from @pikitch_evaluation_1988; 20% discard ratio for 1995--1999, based on the assumption that discard ratios would be higher than previous years but less than years when discard data was present due to the period of non-retention [and consistent with the previous assessment, @thorson_status_2015].  

Onboard observers were deployed on fishing vessels starting in 2002 to collect data on discarding practices. Discard amounts for the domestic trawl, non-trawl, and at-sea hake fisheries from 2002--2021 were determined based on \gls{wcgop} data provided in the \gls{gemm} product (available publically at <https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2022/08/g-1-b-nwfsc-report-1-estimated-discard-and-catch-of-groundfish-species-in-the-2021-west-coast-fisheries.pdf>). The \gls{gemm} provides estimates of dead discards coastwide. Therefore, the total coastwide estimates of dead discards in trawl and fixed gears as provided in the \gls{gemm} were allocated by state based on the total observed landings and discards for each state as observed by \gls{wcgop}. Dead discards were added to landings to obtain total removals for 2002--2021. Total removals in 2000, 2001, and 2022 where no \gls{wcgop} data were available were calculated by applying the average discard ratios from 2002--2004 (for estimates in 2000 and 2001) and 2019--2021 (for estimates in 2022) for each gear to landings for that gear. 


### Recreational landings and discards by state

#### Washington

Washington recreational landings, in number of fish retained, were provided by \gls{wdfw} for 1967 and 1975--2022. Landings estimates starting in 1990 were reworked by the \gls{wdfw} sport sampling unit since the previous assessment. For 1968--1974, a linear ramp between the values in 1967 and 1975 was used to approximate landings. Recreational landings were assumed zero prior to 1967. Documentation for landing estimates compiled for 1987--1989 could not be located by \gls{wdfw}, but were used in lieu of linear interpolation between estimates in 1986 and 1990.

Discard estimates for 2002--2022, in numbers of fish released, were also provided by \gls{wdfw}. Numbers released in specific depth categories were available from 2005--2022, and estimates of the proportion of releases that occurred using descender devices were available from 2016--2022. Released fish at unknown depths were allocated proportional to released fish at known depths in years with depth specific values. For 2002--2004, which had no depth-specific information, the average total release mortality rate in 2005--2007 was used to calculate the number of dead discards. Depth-specific release-mortality rates were based on agreed upon values for canary rockfish for surface releases [Table 1-10; @pfmc2014status] and releases with descender devices [Table 1-13; @pfmc2014status]. The release mortality rates using descender devices in deep waters (30+ fathoms) in [@pfmc2014status] were binned at a finer scale than in the provided data on descender device usage. Number of releases decreased with water depth, so the release morality in 30+ fathoms when using descender devices was assumed as the average of release mortality rates for 30--50 fathoms and 50-100 fathoms from [@pfmc2014status].     

The total discard mortality rate (release rate multiplied by release mortality rate) for 2002 was also applied to 2000--2001 landings. All three years shared a two canary daily bag limit, and were assumed to have similar discarding practices. We assumed zero recreational releases prior to 2000 when canary rockfish was included as part of a ten rockfish daily limit, and release rates were generally low (P. Anderson, personal communication, 03/20/23).

Total removals in the Washington recreational fleet were converted from numbers to weight to maintain consistency with units from other fleets. Length data for sport catches were provided by \gls{wdfw} for 1979--2022. The average length of canary rockfish by year was calculated and converted to average weight based on parameters of the length-weight relationship ($\alpha$ = 1.040E-05 and $\beta$ = 3.084 for length in cm and weight in kg) as used in \gls{recfin}. In years where the number of length samples was fewer than 25, lengths were borrowed from the nearest neighboring years to calculate a three year weighted-average. A value of 25 was used because it was the 'small sample size' threshold used by @dick_lengthborrow_2021 and had increased percent standard error compared to other sample sizes. Borrowing lengths from neighboring years was only applied from years with roughly similar fishing regulations. Thus, lengths were only calculated from neighboring years in the periods <1999 (canary rockfish part of group daily bag limits), 2000--2003 (canary rockfish with individual daily bag limits), 2004--2016 (period of no retention), and 2017--2022 (post non-retention). Any years without lengths were assigned the non-weighted-average length across years within a  period. A non-weighted length was applied to give each year equal weight in calculating an overall average for each period.      


#### Oregon

##### Historic Ocean Boat Landings and Discards (1979--2000)

Recently, \gls{odfw} undertook an effort to comprehensively reconstruct all marine fish recreational ocean boat landings prior to 2001 [@whitman2023, in review]. Reconstructed catch estimates from the \gls{orbs} improve upon estimates from the federal \gls{mrfss}, which have known biases related to effort estimation and sampling [@vanvoorhees2000] that resulted in catch estimates considered implausible by \gls{odfw}. However, the \gls{orbs} sample estimates are known to lack the comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of \gls{mrfss} Addressing this coverage issue is a major part of this reconstruction. In general, the base data and methodology for these reconstructed estimates are consistent with recent assessments for other nearshore species [@cope2021vermillion_or; @langseth2021quillback_or; @taylor2021lingcod_n; @wetzel2021copper_or].

Prior to 2001, \gls{orbs} monitored marine species in both multi-species categories, such as rockfish, flatfish, and other miscellaneous fishes, and individual species, such as lingcod or halibut. For this comprehensive reconstruction, four species categories were selected to reconstruct, including rockfish, lingcod, flatfish and miscellaneous, which constitute the bulk of the managed marine fish species. Canary rockfish are a component of the rockfish species category.

Category-level estimates were expanded to account for gaps in sampling coverage in two separate pathways. First, estimates from five major ports were expanded to include unsampled winter months in years lacking complete coverage. Expansions were based on available year-round sampling data and excluded years where regulations may have impacted the temporal distribution of catch. Second, all other minor port estimates were expanded to include seasonal estimates in years lacking any sampling based on the amount of minor port catch as compared to all major port estimates. A subset of landings were sampled by ORBS for species compositions within these categories. Once category-level landings were comprehensive in space and time, species compositions were applied for the three multi-species categories, including rockfish, flatfish and miscellaneous fish. Borrowing rules for species compositions were specific to the category and determined based on a series of regression tree analyses that detailed the importance of each domain (year, month, port and fishing mode) to variability in compositions.

Ocean boat estimates 1979--2000 in numbers of fish of canary rockfish from the above described methods were converted to biomass using biological samples from MRFSS (A. Whitman, ODFW, personal communication, 2023). \Gls{mrfss} biological data are available 1980--1989 and 1993--2000. An annual average weight was applied to the total annual number of fish to obtain an annual biomass estimate of the landings. Several years of missing biological data (1979, 1990--1992) were filled in using neighboring years or interpolation. Landings from 1979 to 2000 averaged 29.9 mt and are of similar magnitude to the previous assessment, though landings appear to have less interannual variability than the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015]. Landings were relatively high in the first year of available data (1979) and so landings from 1972 to 1978 were initiated at zero in 1972 and linearly ramped up to the value in 1979. The provided landings do not include an estimate of discarded fish, and thus are assumed as total removals. Bag limits in the recreational fishery during this time period (prior to 2001) were generally liberal and \gls{odfw} staff recommended that no additional mortality of discarded fish be included prior to 2001.

##### Modern Ocean Boat Landings and Discards (2001 -- 2022)

Recreational landings for ocean boat modes from 2001--2022 are available from \gls{recfin}. Both retained and released estimates of mortality are included, though retained mortality contributes the vast majority to total mortality in years outside the overfished designation for canary rockfish. Release mortality is estimated from angler-reported release rates and the application of discard mortality rates from the PFMC [@pfmc2014status]. The average proportion of canary rockfish discarded averaged 4.5% in 2001--2003 and 2017--2022. During years where canary rockfish retention was prohibited, discard rates increased to 96.1% on average (2004--2016). From 2001 to 2022, total landings averaged 16.0 mt, ranging from 1.7 to 60.6 mt. In 2022, estimated ocean boat landings were 55.7 mt.

#### California

Recreational landings in California were available from 1928--2022. Historical estimates of recreational landings 1928--1979 were obtained from the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015], which were in turn were obtained from \gls{calcom}. For years since 1979, recreational landings along with estimates of dead discards came from \gls{recfin} via \gls{mrfss} (1980--2003) and \gls{crfs} (2005--2022) sampling programs. Landings and dead discards were added together to obtain estimates of total removals. Discards prior to 1980 were assumed to be zero.

A number of years with missing or incomplete estimates for recreational removals were filled in. The removals in 1980 from \gls{mrfss} were not used due to survey quality problems related to 1980 being the first year of \gls{mrfss} [@Karpov1995, @cope_status_2009]. Removals for this year were averaged across removals in 1979 and 1981. No or minimal party/charter (PC) estimates were available from 1993--1995, so PC mode removals for these years were calculated assuming an average ratio of private/rental (PR) to PC modes across all years with data within \gls{mrfss} and added to PR values to obtain total recreational estimates. The \gls{mrfss} sampling program did not sample from 1990--1992, and so estimates during these three years were obtained as averages from neighboring years. Estimates in 1990 were the average from 1987--1989, estimates in 1991 were the average from 1987--1989 and 1993--1995, and estimates in 1992 were the average from 1993-1995. Because of the transition from \gls{mrfss} to \gls{crfs}, no estimate was available in either database in 2004 for this assessment cycle. \Gls{cdfw} provided a value of 10.59 mt for 2004 (J. Budrick, CDFW, personal communication), based on an available previous pull of \gls{mrfss} data for the gopher rockfish assessment. Estimates for California recreational removals from the previous canary rockfish assessment were not used because these appeared to only reflect estimates of landings, and not total removals. 

##### CA Recreational data impacted by COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted recreational port sampling in 2020 and 2021. No sampling occurred at all in April-June, 2020. \Gls{cdfw} provided proxy values for these months (M. Parker, CDFW, personal communication). Total proxy values for canary rockfish weight were summed across district and added to the existing estimate for 2020 from \gls{recfin}. In addition, California recreational total mortality estimates in the "rockfish genus" were inflated due to \gls{crfs} samplers being unable to closely examine catch and identify catch to species. This was a problem for both PR and PC modes in 2020 and primarily for the PC mode in 2021. An effort was made to allocate some of the rockfish genus mortality to other rockfish species for these modes and years (J. Coates, CDFW, personal communication). An expected value of rockfish genus mortality in 2020 and 2021 was generated by mode and year according to the average proportion to the total rockfish mortality that this category represented in 2018 and 2019, when regulations were consistent with 2020 and 2021. Mortality above this expected value was attributed to the other species also based on proportions each species represented to the total from 2018 and 2019. Calculations were made by year, mode, and district. The shore-based modes were grouped in with the PR mode. Calculations were initially made in numbers of fish because rockfish genus mortality is only recorded this way. Numbers of fish by species were then converted to weight in kilograms based on average weights of fish recorded by the \gls{crfs} program by district in 2019. Total reallocated values for canary rockfish weight were summed across modes and districts and added to existing estimates for 2020 from the sum of the proxy value and \gls{recfin} and for 2021 from \gls{recfin}.

### At Sea Hake Fishery

Catches of canary rockfish are monitored aboard the vessel by observers in the \gls{ashop} and were provided for the years 1975--2022 (V. Tuttle, NOAA, personal communication, 4/3/2023). Observers use a spatial sample design, based on weight, to randomly choose a portion of the haul to sample for species composition. For the last decade, this is typically 30-50% of the total weight. The total weight of the sample is determined by all catch passing over a flow scale. All species other than hake are removed and weighed, by species, on a motion compensated flatbed scale. Observers record the weights of all non-hake species. Non-hake species total weights are expanded in the database by using the proportion of the haul sampled to the total weight of the haul. The catches of non-hake species in unsampled hauls is determined using bycatch rates determined from sampled hauls. Since 2001, more than 97% of the hauls have been observed and sampled.

Values for percentages of the catch that was retained were available in the data starting in 1997. When not provided, we assumed percent retained was 100 percent. We also assumed that any canary rockfish not retained were dead. We therefore added the retained landings to the amount of landings not retained to obtained total removals.  

Total removals were partitioned to state based on latitude, with retrieved hauls from 46.25 N to 49 N assigned to Washington, 42 N to 46.25 N assigned to Oregon, and < 42 N assigned to California. Starting in 1992, processing of at sea hake was restricted to north of 42 N [@fed_registry_1992]. Very small catches occurring south of 42 N were assigned to Oregon. Starting in 1997, percent retained was tracked. Due to confidentiality, catches in 1975 were not reported or used within the model, and catches in 1976 were combined and assigned to Oregon.

### Foreign Catches

From the 1960s through the early 1970s, foreign trawling enterprises harvested considerable amounts of rockfish off Washington and Oregon, including large quantities of canary rockfish. Foreign catches of individual species were estimated by @rogers_species_2003 and attributed to \gls{inpfc} areas from 1966-1976 for canary rockfish. \Gls{inpfc} areas do not coincide with the spatial strata defined in this assessment. Therefore, INPFC catches were translated to strata in the following manner: catches from the US Vancouver INPFC area were designated to the 46-49°N stratum (Washington), catches in the Columbia INPFC area were allocated to the 42-46°N stratum (Oregon), and catches from the Eureka and Monterey INPFC areas were assigned to the 32-42°N stratum (California). These definitions match where the majority of commercial trawl landings occur by state for each INPFC area within \gls{pacfin}.

## Composition data

Commercial landings of rockfish and the biological characteristics of these landings were not consistently sampled for scientific purposes until the early 1960s (Niska, 1976). Statewide sampling programs to determine species compositions of the landed catches began in the late 1960s. The first rigorous monitoring programs that included routine collection of biological data (e.g., sex, age, size, maturity states, etc.) were begun in 1980. Currently, port biologists employed by each state fishery agency (\gls{odfw}, \gls{wdfw}) or \gls{psmfc} with the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) collect species-composition information and biological data from the landed catches of commercial vessels that have completed their fishing trips. The sampling sites are commonly processing facilities located at ports along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. The monitoring programs currently in place are generally based on stratified, multistage sampling designs.

Recreational landings of rockfish and the biological characteristics of these landings were not consistently sampled for scientific purposes until the late 1970s. The first rigorous monitoring programs that included routine collection of biological data (e.g., sex, age, size, maturity states, etc.) were begun in 1980 by the national \gls{mrfss} program under the \gls{psmfc} and by state sampling programs. State sampling programs replaced \gls{mrfss} in the 2003--2004 period to better support in season management. Currently, port biologists employed by each state fishery management agency (\gls{cdfw}, \gls{odfw}, \gls{wdfw}) collect catch, effort, and biological data from the landed catches of recreational vessels that have completed their fishing trips. Onboard sampling also occurs on party/charter vessels in Oregon and California. 

Twenty-eight bins from 12 to 66 cm were used to summarize the length frequency distributions of fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources of catch. The first bin includes all observations less than 12 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 66 cm. Thirty-five bins from age 1 to age 35 were used to summarize the age frequency distributions of fishery-dependent sources of catch, with the last bin including all fish aged greater than 35 years. Conditional age at length data was used to summarize fishery-independent sources of age data, and is described in more detailed in Section \@ref(TO DO: add section here).
**Fix reference to section above**


### Fishery-Dependent Composition Data

#### Commercial trawl and non-trawl fisheries

Length- and marginal age-frequency distributions were calculated for each commercial fleet for which observations were available. Biological length and age data were extracted from the \gls{pacfin} Biological Data System on May 8, 2023. Biological data were divided into trawl and nontrawl fleets for each state according to the fleet structure used for this assessment. Length samples were available starting in 1977 for California fleets, 1973 for Oregon fleets, and 1968 for Washington fleets. Age samples were available starting in 1980 for all states' fleets. There was a mix of biological length and age samples with and without sex information but the majority of length and nearly all age samples included information on sex, so were modelled as sex specific compositions. 

During data exploration it was noted that samples previously labelled as special project samples from Oregon were appropriate to represent dynamics from the fishery. The majority of these occurred during 1973--1986, and therefore 5,859 special project samples from Oregon up through 1986 were retained for composition data. Also during data exploration, there were 700 age samples from Washington without a final age determination. These represented a small proportion of samples among the years which they occurred and so were excluded.

*TO DO: DO surface read sensitivity or exclude the text below about doing it*
Among age samples, 6,645 were from surface reads, starting in 1973 for Oregon and 1975 for Washington. Ages of surface reads were truncated to around 30 prior to 1980, and were more similar to break and burn reads when both were available starting in 1980. Given known biases of surface reads, and the clear truncation in years where only surface years were available, we excluded surface reads from age compositions. A sensitivity to the presence of surface read showed negligible effect on model results (see Section \@ref(sensitivities)). 

For commercial trawl and nontrawl fleets, the raw observations (compiled from \gls{pacfin}) were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. These expanded length and age observations were then combined within a year for each fleet.

The input sample sizes for the expanded commercial length and age data were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) which incorporates the number of trips or hauls and fish by year:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

The magnitude of sampling for each fleet and year are given in Table \@ref{tab:comm-sample-lengths} and Table \@ref{tab:comm-sample-age}, which shows the different magnitudes of sampling across time and between state agencies. Thess tables show both the total number of fish samples as well as the number of trips by year and state over which samples were obtained. 

During modeling we noticed sparse length and age composition data of unsexed fish for a few years across fleets. Years with very few unsexed length and age samples relative to sexed samples were excluded from the model. See [Appendix A](#excluded-data) for implied fits to these length and age data.
*We may not even need implied fits to these. A sensitivity would be to remove anything less than a certain number, whether sexed or unsexed*

**Many assessment include actual lengths. Could add in like I did for rec fleets**
The weighted commercial length-frequency distributions are shown in (Figures \ref{fig:CA_twl_lencomp}-\ref{fig:WA_ntwl_lencomp}). A number of important patterns are visible in the data although the data are noise. The trawl fleets appear to show a decline in mean length of the catch from 1978 to 1990 for California and from around 1980 to 2000 for Oregon (Figures \ref{fig:CA_twl_lencomp} and \ref{fig:OR_twl_lencomp}), with variable length since 2000 and some increase from around 2013 for the Oregon and Washington trawl fleets (Figures \ref{fig:OR_twl_lencomp} and \ref{fig:WA_twl_lencomp}). The length-frequency distributions from the non-trawl fleet are much more sparse compared to the trawl fleet, especially during the period of no retention where no lengths were sampled, making it difficult to discern a pattern in the mean length landed (Figures \ref{fig:CA_ntwl_lencomp}-\ref{fig:WA_ntwl_lencomp}). However, Oregon non-trawl lengths show some decline during the 1990s and Oregon and California non-trawl lengths show increases in the most recent years, though these can also be explained by changes in regulations for `r spp` in recent years. 

**Many assessment include actual ages. Could add in like I did for rec fleets**
The weighted marginal commercial age-frequency distributions are shown in (Figures \ref{fig:CA_twl_agecomp}-\ref{fig:WA_ntwl_agecomp}). Age data for California were very sparse (no data between 1987 and 2001 as well as after 2009) compared to age data from Oregon and Washington (Figure \ref{fig:CA_twl_agecomp}). Age compositions for the trawl fleets were generally similar, ranging from approximately 5 to 25 years, with peaks at 10 years of age for both sexes. Oregon trawl fleet show a clear decline from around age 20 from the mid-1980s to around age 10 in 2000, with periods of increases each decade since 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:OR_twl_agecomp}). Washington age data show highly variable patterns that make general patterns difficult to determine Figure \ref{fig:WA_twl_agecomp}. Age data for the non-trawl fleet for all states are sparse enough that no pattern can reliably be discerned (Figures Figure \ref{fig:CA_ntwl_agecomp}-\ref{fig:WA_ntwl_agecomp}) though the distribution of ages in Washington is shifted towards older `r spp` compared to other states' non-trawl and trawl fisheries. 
  
#### At-Sea-Hake fishery 

Length- and marginal age-frequency distributions were calculated for the at-sea-hake fishery using data collected by the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{ashop} (extracted on 3/31/23 for lengths and 5/1/2023 for ages). Length and age observations were available starting in 2003, which was after the period that at sea processing was restricted to north of 42$^\circ N$. Consequently, length and age compositions were only available only for Oregon and Washington components of the at sea hake fishery. Raw observations were aggregated within a year for each fleet, and the input sample sizes for composition data was the number of hauls. 

The magnitude of sampling for the at-sea-hake fishery is given in Table \@ref{tab:ashop-sample-lengths} and Table \@ref{tab:ashop-sample-age}. These tables show both the total number of fish samples as well as the number of trips by year and state over which samples were obtained and which were used as input sample sizes. During modeling we noticed sparse length and age composition data of unsexed fish for a few years across fleets. Years with very few unsexed length and age samples relative to sexed samples were excluded from the model. See [Appendix A](#excluded-data) for implied fits to these length and age data.

**Many assessment include actual ages. Could add in like I did for rec fleets**
The at-sea hake fishery was comprised of similarly sized `r spp` relative to the commercial trawl fisheries and exhibited little trend over time (Figures \ref{fig:OR_hake_lencomp}-\ref{fig:WA_hake_lencomp}). Age data were also comparable to ages from the commercial trawl fisheries and show little discernible pattern over time (Figures \ref{fig:OR_hake_agecomp}-\ref{fig:WA_hake_agecomp}). 


#### Foreign fishery

No length or age data were available from foreign fleets. Selectivity of these fleets was assumed to be the same as the state specific trawl fisheries.


#### Recreational fishery

Length- and marginal age-frequency distributions were calculated for each recreational fleet for which observations were available. Biological length and age composition data were extracted from various sources. For Washington, biological samples starting in 1979 (for lengths) were obtained from sport biodata as provided by \gls{wdfw} on April 27, 2023. Age samples began in 2004. For Oregon, biological samples starting in 1980 (for lengths) were obtained from \gls{odfw} via the \gls{mrfss} and \gls{orbs} sampling programs as accessed via \gls{recfin} on January 25, 2023 for lengths and April 28, 2023 for ages. Age samples began in 1999. For California, length samples 1980--2003 were obtained via the \gls{mrfss} sampling program as accessed via \gls{recfin} (accessed March 30, 2023) and provided by \gls{cdfw}. Length samples starting in 2003 were obtained via the \gls{crfs} sampling program as accessed via the \gls{recfin} website (accessed April 14, 2023). Length samples collected from the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard CPFV survey for 1987--1998 were also obtained from \gls{cdfw}. California has no age samples of `r spp`.  

Between 1987-1989 and 1993-1998 there were recreational length data for the CPFV fleet from both MRFSS and the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data sets. During data exploration it was determined that the lengths in MRFSS from 1997 and 1998 were also included in the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data, indicating that these data sources were duplicated for these years but also potentially other years where they overlapped. In order to avoid duplicate data, the length data from \gls{mrfss} for private/charter mode, which had far fewer length samples for the overlapping years with Deb Wilson-Vandenberg for the CPFV fleet, were removed from the data used within the model. A sensitivity was run using only the \gls{mrfss} data to test the effect of this choice (see Section \@ref(sensitivities)).

Biological length data were aggregated across party/charter and private/rental mode based on similarity in the overall length distributions, and consistent with past canary rockfish assessments. There was a mix of biological length and age samples with and without sex information. The majority of length samples for Washington and Oregon, and all length samples for California did not include information on sex. The majority of age samples included information on sex, so were modeled as sex-specific age distributions. Only lengths from retained fish were used as were samples from ocean areas. In addition, \gls{odfw} provided \gls{mrfss} length samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values. A sensitivty to using lengths from both retained and released fish was explored and described in Section \@ref(sensitivities). Altogether there were very limited number of samples from inland/estuary areas and from which direct measurements were not available so no sensitivity of inclusion of these samples was done.    

For each fleet, the raw observations were aggregated within a year. A catch-weighted approach was explored for Oregon and Washington observations from \gls{recfin} because these states have a formalized appraoch (E.J. Dick, personal communication, \gls{swfsc}) and a separate data table exists within \gls{recfin} (J. Edwards, personal communication, \gls{psmfc}) that includes the weightings. The catch-weighted distributions were very similar to the disributions based on raw observations, so raw distributions were used for simplicity.

The approach to determine the input sample sizes for the recreational length and age data varied by data source and data type. Some data sources had unique trip numbers within the data (Deb Wilson-Vandenberg and Oregon CPFV releases). Other data sources that lacked a clear trip identifier used combinations of multiple fields to attempt to estimate unique combinations that represented the number of trips sampled. In general the number of trips for both age and length composition data was estimated based on a mix of time, location, and fishery type. The number of trips for length and age compositions from Washington sport biodata was estimated using a combination of fish sample date (or sample date if blank), fish (or sample) punch card area, and fishing mode. The number of trips for length compositions from \gls{orbs} sampling was estimated using a field (ANGLER_ID) that encompasses time, area, and fishing mode. The number of trips for age composition from \gls{orbs} sampling was estimated using sampling date, sampling site (PORT_NAME), and fishing mode. The number of trips for length compositions from \gls{mrfss} sampling was estimated using year and id code, \gls{mrfss} area code and sampling location (INTSITE for California or ORBSport for Oregon), and fishery mode. The number of trips for length compositions from \gls{crfs} sampling was estimated using sampling date, sampling site (COUNTY_NUMBER), and fishing area and mode. Collectively, the estimates for the number of trips are meant to represent a reasonable starting point that generally reflects the degree of similarity of information from sampling a given number of likely similar fish within any sampling events.

The magnitude of sampling for each fleet and year are given in Table \@ref{tab:rec-sample-lengths} and Table \@ref{tab:rec-sample-age}, and show the different sampling frequencies employed over different time periods and between state agencies. These tables show both the total number of fish samples as well as the number of trips by year and state over which samples were obtained and which were used as input sample sizes. 

During modeling we noticed sparse age composition data of unsexed fish for a few years across recreational fleets. Years with very few unsexed age samples relative to sexed samples were excluded from the model. See [Appendix A](#excluded-data) for implied fits to these age data.
*We may not even need implied fits to these. A sensitivity would be to remove anything less than a certain number, whether sexed or unsexed*

The recreational length-frequency distributions are shown in (Figures \ref{fig:CA_rec_lencomp}-\ref{fig:WA_rec_lencomp}). All three recreational fleets appear to generally target smaller fish relative to the commercial fleets within the same state. Recreational lengths from California are highly variable, with sizes typically between 20-40 cm, but with sudden shifts in time (Figure \ref{fig:CA_rec_lencomp}). Recreational lengths from Oregon are less variable and typically range 25-40 cm, but had limited and variable sampling during the period of non-retention (Figure \ref{fig:OR_rec_lencomp}). In Washington, recreational lengths tend to be larger than in either California and Oregon, typically ranging from 30-45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:WA_rec_lencomp}). Length distributions for all recreational fleets showed an increase is sizes in recent years, which could be due to changes in regulations. Length distributions for Oregon and Washington also showed patterns of bimodality with a peak around 35 cm and then another around 50 cm (Figure \ref{fig:agglencomp}. This pattern was not due to combining across modes as it was present for both party/charter and private/rental modes.  

The recreational marginal age-frequency distributions are shown in (Figures \ref{fig:OR_rec_agecomp}-\ref{fig:WA_rec_agecomp}). Recreational ages were typically younger than in commercial fisheries. Ages ranged between 5-10 years but had long tails of older fish, with a larger proportional tail of older fish observed in Washington compared to Oregon. An increase in the age of sampled catch was observed in both Washington and Oregon recreational fleets, although the few years of Washington samples makes comparisons difficult. The changes in regulations in recent years complicate whether this pattern was due to increased ages of fish in the population or changes in fishing practices. 



*This section below (commented out) is really just fishery-independent comps - and mostly CAAL for the surveys KLO: I removed the data pieces, what remains is more a description of CAAL which I think belongs more in modeling.*
<!-- ### Expansion of length and age-composition samplmes -->

<!-- Age-frequency data from the Triennial and WCGBT surveys were compiled as conditional age-at-length distributions by sex and year. Individual length- and age-observations can be thought of as entries in an age-length key (matrix), with age across the columns and length down the rows. The approach consists of tabulating the sums within rows as the standard length-frequency distribution and, instead of also tabulating the sums to the age margin, instead the distribution of ages in each row of the age-length key is treated as a separate observation, conditioned on the row (length) from which it came. This approach has several benefits for analysis above the standard use of marginal age compositions. First, age structures are generally collected as a subset of the fish that have been measured. If the ages are to be used to create an external age-length key to transform the lengths to ages, then the uncertainty due to sampling and missing data in the key are not included in the resulting age-compositions used in the stock assessment. If the marginal age compositions are used with the length compositions in the assessment, the information content on sex-ratio and year class strength is largely double-counted as the same fish are contributing to likelihood components that are assumed to be independent. Using conditional age-distributions for each length bin allows only the additional information provided by the limited age data (relative to the generally far more numerous length observations) to be captured, without creating a 'double-counting' of the data in the total likelihood. The second major benefit to using conditional age-composition observations is that in addition to being able to estimate the basic growth parameters (L age-1, L age-30, K) inside the assessment model, the distribution of lengths at a given age, usually governed by two parameters; the CV of length at some young age and the CV at a much older age, are also quite reliably estimated. This information could only be derived from marginal age-composition observations where very strong and well-separated cohorts existed, that were quite accurately aged and measured; rare conditions at best. By fully estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model, this major source of uncertainty is included in the assessment results, and bias due to size-based selectivity is avoided. Therefore, to retain objective weighting of the length and age data, and to fully include the uncertainty in growth parameters (and avoid potential bias due to external estimation where size-based selectivity is operating) conditional age at-length compositions were developed for the triennial and WCGBT survey data. -->

## Fishery-Independent Data

Fishery-independent data are derived from three main sampling programs: the \gls{s-tri} (1980-2004), the \gls{s-wcgbt},  and the pre-recruit survey (2001-2022).  Each source of information is used to generate an index of abundance.  The triennial and WCGBTS also provide age and length-composition sampling data and were extracted on May 1, 2023 and February 13, 2023, respectively.

### West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The WCGBTS is based on a random-grid design, covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design uses four vessels per year (except in years 2004 and 2014, when only three vessels were available, and 2020 when the survey did not occur due to COVID-19), assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells divided into two ‘passes’. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The WCGBTS encounters canary infrequently, generally in less than 10% of the total tows conducted, though this includes slope tows well beyond the depth canary inhabit (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts}). However, when canary aggregations are encountered, catches can be as large as 4.9 mt in a single 12-15 minute tow; this equates to an average density of approximately 1 kg·2.5 m$^{-2}$. There are 19 tows that have encountered at least 500 kg of canary, and four tows have encountered over 1000 kg (2088 kg in 2015, 3033 kg in 2017, 3650 kg in 2018, and 3984 kg in 2006). These large tows are located primarily off the northern Washington coast near the Canadian border, with some located off the Oregon or Northern California coasts. The presence of infrequent very large tows creates a strongly right-skewed distribution of catch rates, still visible after log-transformation. These very large catches do not appear to be dominated by either very large individuals or very small individuals, indicating that these areas represent neither recruitment ‘hot-spots’, nor unexploited ‘pockets’ of very old canary rockfish.

### Triennial Survey

Prior to the \gls{s-wcgbt}, the triennial shelf trawl survey conducted by NMFS starting in 1977 served as the main fishery-independent data source regarding the abundance of canary rockfish in the California Current [@dark_distribution_1994]. The sampling methods used in the survey over the 24-year period are most recently described in Weinberg et al. [-@weinberg_2001_2002]; the basic design was a series of equally spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. In some parts of the coast this led to a very non-random allocation of stations with regard to the entire shelf area *TODO: Figure*(Figure \ref{}). In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the survey in 1977 was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the survey in 1992 spanned from mid-July through early October; the survey in 1995 was conducted from early June to late July; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001/2004 surveys were conducted in May-July. The initial year of the survey in 1977 was based on a sampling design that spanned from 50 to 260 fm. (91 to 475 m), i.e., it did not come as far inshore (30 fm.) as the subsequent surveys conducted on a triennial basis from 1980 to 2001. 

Surveys that have extended south of Monterey have detected only very small abundances relative to the north, so changes in sampling in this area does not influence the relative index. Because of the large number of ‘water hauls’ eliminated in 1977, especially in the US Vancouver INPFC area, and because the sampling depths were not the same as the other years, the 1977 survey year was not used in the assessment. A full description of the water haul issue can be found in Zimmerman et al. [-@zimmermann_retrospective_2001]. 

### Pre-recruit survey

*We have some figures in this text (4 and 5) that we dont have figures for*

The Fishery Ecology Division of the Southwest Fishery Science Center has conducted a standardized pelagic juvenile trawl survey (the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey) during May-June every year since 1983 [@ralston_juvrockfish_2013; @sakuma2016anomalous; @field2021spatiotemporal]. A primary purpose of the survey is to estimate the abundance of pelagic juvenile rockfishes (*Sebastes spp.*) and to develop indices of year-class strength for use in groundfish stock assessments on the U. S. West Coast. This is possible because the survey samples young-of-the-year rockfish when they are ~100 days old, an ontogenetic stage that occurs after year-class strength is established, but well before cohorts recruit to commercial and recreational fisheries. This survey has encountered tremendous interannual variability in the abundance of the species that are routinely indexed, as well as high apparent synchrony in abundance among the ten most frequently encountered species [@ralston_juvrockfish_2013]. Past assessments have used data from this survey to provide indices of year-class strength (as relative age-0 abundance), including the 2015 Canary rockfish assessment, and assessments for widow rockfish [@adams_status_2019], blue/deacon rockfish [@dick2018bluedeacon], bocaccio [@he_status_2015], shortbelly rockfish [@field_status_2007], and chilipepper rockfish [@field_status_2015].

Historically, the survey was conducted between $36^\circ 30^\prime$N and $38^\circ 20^\prime$N latitude (the ‘core area’ from approximately Carmel, CA to just north of Point Reyes, CA), but starting in 2004 the spatial coverage expanded to cover from the U.S./Mexico border to Cape Mendocino. Additionally, since 2001 data are available from comparable surveys conducted by the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative and the \gls{nwfsc} (2001--2009) and the \gls{nwfsc} “Pre-recruit” survey (2011--2022) for waters off of Oregon and Washington [@field_spatiotemporal_2021]. Coastwide data have revealed both spatial differences in species composition (e.g. north and south of Point Conception) and interannual shifts in the distribution of most pelagic juvenile rockfishes: The near absence of fish in the core survey area during the 2005--2007 period, which saw two of the lowest abundance levels of juvenile rockfish ever observed in the core area time series, was associated with an apparent redistribution of fish, both to the north and the south [@ralston_prerecruit_2013]. As the core area index seems to have failed to capture the magnitude of the 1999 year class for most stocks, the recommendations from the juvenile rockfish survey workshop held in 2005 were to use only the coastwide data (since 2001) for juvenile indices rather than the longer-term ‘core area’ indices unless a convincing case could be made otherwise. We used data from 2001 to 2022, the period for which we have coastwide coverage. On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, sampling in 2020 was very limited and restricted to the historical core area, so this year is excluded. In the years 2010, 2012, and 2022, sampling did not span the entire coastwide spatial domain, with data lacking from northern CA and OR **TODO:**(Figure \ref{}). These years were not included in the model, but sensitivity of the stock assessment to inclusion of the index for these years is explored in sensitivities. 

Catch per tow was adjusted to a common age of 100 days to account for interannual differences in age structure, as has been done for prior assessment indices using this dataset.

### Index standardization

Geostatistical models of biomass density were fit to all three survey datasets using \gls{tmb}
[@kristensen_tmb:_2016] via the R package \gls{sdmtmb} [@Anderson:2022:SRP].
These models can account for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random
field and spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a random walk Guassian random
field [@thorson_geostatistical_2015]. Tweedie, delta-binomial, delta-gamma, and mixture distributions, which
allow for extreme catch events, were investigated. Results are only shown for
the distribution that led to the best model diagnostics, e.g., similar
distributions of theoretical normal quantiles and model quantiles, high
precision, lack of extreme predictions that are incompatible with the life
history, and low \gls{aic}. Estimates of biomass from this best model were
predicted using a grid based on available survey locations. Code to
reproduce the analysis is available at
https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/indexwc.


#### \gls{s-wcgbt}

The data were truncated to depths less than 275 m prior to modelling given that there were zero positive encounters in depths deeper than 275 m. The prediction grid was also truncated to only include available survey locations in depths between 55--275 m to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects.

The model used a delta model with a lognormal distribution for the catch-rate component.
A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates.
The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. Pass was also included as a covariate.
Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey,
were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects
were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of
vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of
commercial vessels used during sampling
[@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014].

Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter probability model and spatial variation was included in the positive catch rate model. The variance of the spatiotemporal effect was estimated to be less than 0.01 for the positive catch rate model and was therefore not included in the final model.
Spatial variation was approximated using 200 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.

#### \gls{s-tri}

The data were truncated to depths less than 366 m and latitudes north of $37^\circ$N prior to modelling to control for temporal changes in survey extent. No canary were ever encountered below 366 m and only 13 tows encountered canary south of $37^\circ$N out of 831 total tows that encountered canary. The data also excluded any tows outside of the U.S. exclusive economic zone (i.e., in Canadian waters). The prediction grid was truncated to these same extents to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects. 

The model used a delta model with a lognormal distribution for the catch-rate component.
A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates.
The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year.
No other covariates were modelled.
Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey,
were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects
were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of
vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of
commercial vessels used during sampling
[@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014].

Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter probability model and spatial variation was included in the positive catch rate model. The variance of the spatiotemporal effect was estimated to be less than 0.01 for the positive catch rate model and was therefore not included in the final model.
Spatial variation was approximated using 200 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.

#### Pre-recruit survey

For the index model, we used data from 35–$48.2^\circ$N latitude (just north of Point Conception to La Push, WA). Canary rockfish were never caught south of $35^\circ$N. Since catch (and sampling) varied over space and time, we modeled catch using a spatial GLM with the package \gls{sdmtmb} [@Anderson:2022:SRP]. The 100-day-standardized catch per tow was modeled as a function of fixed year effects along with Julian date (GAM smoother with k=4) to account for seasonality, a spatial random field, and IID spatiotemporal random fields. 

We fit the model using 3 different error structures: tweedie, delta-lognormal, and delta-gamma. Dharma quantile residuals from model simulations suggested that tweedie distribution was the best fit, and so was used. The tweedie model also best reproduced the observed proportion of zeros in the data based on simulations from the fitted model. As expected, the Julian date effect showed a decline in catch towards the end of the sampling season, as juveniles begin to settle out of the water column. 

For the coastwide index, predictions from the model were made for all active sample stations within the survey region, for the mean Julian date, for each year. Predictions were added together for each year to produce the index. Active stations are those regularly and consistently sampled, and are located on a semi-regular grid spanning the sampling region. Interpolating to a finer spatial grid had little impact on the resulting index.

*NOTE: May or may not keep this in as it describes the state indices*
For state specific indices, we used predictions to active stations from the coastwide model, subdivided by state. The California index used stations south of $42^\circ$N, the Oregon index used stations between $42^\circ$ N and $42.25^\circ$ N, and the Washington index used stations norther of $42.25^\circ$N. Lengthy discussions were had as to whether to subdivide predictions from the coastwide model or to fit separate models for each state. Part of the difficulty with state-specific models is the sparsity of samples and positive catches from Oregon and Washington, which make it difficult to estimate the spatial and spatiotemporal random fields as well as the effect of Julian date. Additionally, when samples are split up by state, there end up being some years in all states with no positive catches, for which index values cannot be estimated using fixed year effects or year-by-state interactions. Using the coastwide model for the state-specific indices allows data from adjacent states to improve estimation of spatial fields near the borders and allows better estimation of the spatial scale of autocorrelation and Julian date effects, while still allowing abundance in each state to be determined by local data through the spatiotemporal fields. In model exploration for black rockfish (specifically the Oregon index for the combination of black and yellowtail rockfishes, which had similar positive catch rates as canary rockfish), fitting a nonspatial model spatially restricted to Oregon produced a similar index to a spatiotemporal model using additional data from California and southern Washington (with predictions restricted to Oregon) for years in which sampling occurred in Oregon. Thus we decided for sake of parsimony and to maximize the use of available data to subdivide the coastwide model, to exclude from the indices state/year combinations in which no sampling occurred at all (2010 for OR, and 2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2021 for WA), because in these years there is no local data to inform the index. As with the coastwide index, 2020 was excluded for all state-specific indices. Due to data sparsity (low number of samples and low number of positive catches), we consider the indices for Oregon and Washington to be more uncertain than California, with the Washington index most uncertain.

### Survey composition data

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wcgbts.summary <- readr::read_csv(here('documents/tables/wcgbts_summary.csv'))
triennial.summary <- readr::read_csv(here('documents/tables/triennial_summary.csv'))
```

Twenty-eight bins from 12 to 66 cm were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year, the first bin including all observations less than 12 cm and the last bin including all fish larger than 66 cm. For the length-composition samples from the WCGBTS, these bins are populated with a modest, but consistent degree of sampling: `r min(wcgbts.summary[,'N positive tows'])`-`r max(wcgbts.summary[,'N positive tows'])` tows and `r min(wcgbts.summary[,'N lengths'])`-`r max(wcgbts.summary[,'N lengths'])` fish lengths per year (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts}). The Triennial survey (Table \ref{tab:triennial}) had both more positive tows each year (`r min(triennial.summary[,'N positive tows'])`-`r max(triennial.summary[,'N positive tows'])`) and more fish lengths per year (`r min(triennial.summary[,'N lengths'])`-`r max(triennial.summary[,'N lengths'])`).

Age distributions included 35 bins from age 1 to age 35, with the last bin including all fish of greater age. Input sample sizes for conditional age-at-length were fixed at the number of unique fish within a given length bin. The age samples consist of approximately one-quarter as many fish as the samples for length (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts} and \ref{tab:triennial}). These distributions show a tight range of ages at a given length, and clearly show the growth trajectory of females reaching larger sizes than males for a given age (Figure \ref{fig:spatial_AL}). Besides the addition of recent survey years, this assessment also includes data for the first time from recently aged otoliths from the 1986 \gls{s-tri}.

## Biological Data

\gls{nwfsc}

The stock assessment model requires specifying several life history
parameters from analyses external to the model. These parameters include
the maturity schedule, fecundity (the relationship between female
length/weight and egg production), the natural mortality rate for males,
the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship, the relationship
between individual weight and length, and estimates of error for
determinations of individual age from reading otoliths.

*NEED TO ADD THIS TABLE* Table \ref{tab:growth-tab} shows the
weight-at-age, maturity-at-age, and spawning output (the product of
fecundity and maturity) assumed in the base model, as well as the
internally estimated length-at-age relationship.

*Do we want to add sample sizes to these. For the sake of time Im not
included samples sizes, yet other assessments have used these*

### Natural Mortality

Due to an unexplained male-skewed sex ratio at older ages observed
across fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data sources, canary
rockfish natural mortality has been modeled in a number of ways over the
years. @sampson1996canary modeled a linear ramp in female natural
mortality from 0.06 yr$^{-1}$ at age 9 to roughly 0.18 yr$^{-1}$ at age
25, the plus group. In 1999, the ramp was adjusted to be from 0.06 at
age 11 to 0.20 at age 25, and the document contains an extensive review
of life history theory regarding increasing female natural mortality
[@stat1999canary]. @methot2002canary fixed male and young female natural
mortality at 0.06, but estimated an offset for older females, and based
the slope of increasing natural mortality on maturity, not age,
resulting in a non-linear ramp by age. In 2005, that option was no
longer available in stock synthesis, so the assessment approximated the
2001 pattern by using a linear ramp from age 6 to age 14, again
estimating a female offset [@methot2005canary]. This has been the
approach for all canary rockfish assessments since 2005.

The increased ramp in natural mortality was also used in yellowtail
rockfish assessments prior to 2005 with support from
[@tagart_yellowtail_1991] that the senescent mortality hypothesis fit
the fishery age data well, and was a better biological explanation for
the disappearance of older age females than the alternative hypothesis
that the older females were not vulnerable to the fishery. The pattern
of male-skewed sex ratio at older ages has been observed along the U.S.
West Coast in fishery data off Oregon (Rasmussen pers. comm. ODFW) and
Alaska and in black rockfish in addition to canary and yellowtail
rockfishes. Although it has been found in these three semi-pelagic
species, the pattern has not been observed for bocaccio, chilipepper
rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, or dusky rockfishes (in Alaska), which
are also semi-pelagic. However, starting in the 2010's the male-skewed
sex ratio has evened out in fishery data off Oregon (Rasmussen pers.
comm. ODFW). The pattern has remained within the \gls{s-wcgbt} and has
not evened off in recent years.

*Probably add more background maybe if we have time. We have the Brooks
thesis, and then the Sampson paper that offer alternatives but aren't
complete.*

IF USE A BREAKPOINT: In this assessment, we updated the longevity-based
prior for the natural mortality rate for males and young females based
on @hamel2022development, using a maximum age of 84 yrs as was done in
the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015; @love2002rockfishes].
This results in a lognormal prior with a log-mean of -2.74, a
log-standard deviation of 0.31, and a median natural mortality of 0.0643
yr$^{-1}$ (used as the fixed value). Instead of a ramp, which requires
the analyst to select two ages, we used a breakpoint, which only
requires selecting a single age and is thus more parsimonious. Rather
than placing the breakpoint around the point of 50 percent maturity, at
which point there is little evidence in the data of sex ratios deviating
from 50:50, we placed the breakpoint between ages 20 and 21. This means
female mortality stayed at the low value for more years than in recent
assessments, and is more aligned with where the ratio of females begins
to decline in survey data.

IF USE A SINGLE VALUE: In this assessment, we elected to model natural
mortality for males and females separately. We updated the
longevity-based prior for the natural mortality rate for males and
females based on @hamel2022development, using a maximum age of 84 yrs as
was done in the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015;
@love2002rockfishes]. This results in a lognormal prior with a log-mean
of -2.74, a log-standard deviation of 0.31, and a median natural
mortality of 0.0643 yr$^{-1}$ for both sexes. As was done in the
previous assessments, we fixed the male natural mortality value at the
prior and estimate female natural mortality. The same maximum age for
males and females was used. Estimating separate male and female natural
mortality removes the need for a user-selected breakpoint at which
natural mortality changes, and has been done in the past assessments for
yellowtail [@stephens_status_2017] and black rockfish for Washington and
California [@cope_assessments_2016].

### Maturation and Fecundity

#### Maturity

We estimate the maturity schedule using available histological
measurements from female ovaries. This includes 163 samples collected by
\gls{odfw} and \gls{wdfw} during winter (October--February) in 2014,
2015, and 2016; and 527 ovaries collected during the \gls{s-wcgbt} in
2009--2016 across a range of depths (57--222 m) and latitudes
(35.7--48.3$^\circ N$) and 53 collected during the \gls{s-hkl} between
2009--2022.

We use functional maturity rather than biological maturity as the
measure of maturity in this assessment. Rockfish begin the process of
maturing several years before they reach spawning potential. Thus
biological maturity would indicate that yolk is present but not that the
fish is spawning capable. Juveniles in abortive maturation and adults in
skip spawning would be marked as biologically mature but functionally
immature. Biological maturity indicates the fish was putting energy
reserves toward spawning, but not necessarily spawning capable for the
year; while functional maturity captures the actual spawners.

We estimate maturity in this assessment using age at maturity. Not all
histological samples included ages, so a total of 777 samples were used
for estimating age at maturity. We assume age at maturity follows a
two-parameter logistic regression model with an asymptote at 1 based on
the findings of [@head_maturity_2016] and fits to histological samples.
Parameters were fixed in the model at estimates from the logistic
regression, and were
`r paste0('$A_{50\\%} =', round(model$Growth_Parameters$Mat1[1], 2), '$')`
and slope
`r paste0('$\\alpha =', round(model$Growth_Parameters$Mat2[1], 2), '$')`.
This relationship is an improvement to the maturity curve used in the
previous assessment, as it uses functional maturity instead of
biological maturity. This, in addition to the use of age instead of
length, eliminated the need for a third parameter in the maturity curve
estimating the probability of skip spawning. Due to the relatively steep
growth curve of `r spp`, a given length can represent a wide range of
ages. The new relationship results in a rightward shift in maturity and
increase in maturity at older ages compared to the relationship derived
within the 2015 assessment (Figure \ref{fig:compare_maturity}). *TO
DO:add data to figure*

*Text that melissa provided is below but simplified. This may be too
detailed. Dont have to defend the previous assessment KLO: I took the
key points from this and moved them into the paragraph above. I think
reviewers will appreciate conciseness, but feel free to edit further.*
<!-- The previous assessments used length at maturity modeled as a three parameter logistic which allowed an asymptote less than 1 to account for occurrence of skip spawning [@thorson_status_2015]. Previous maturity results were based on maturity estimates similar to biological maturity. Maturity was defined if yolk or more advanced stages of maturity were present and the fish was not in mass atresia. Thus abortive maturation fish may have been included in results, and would have been assumed to be adult skip spawning. This would impact the asymptote. For this assessment samples were re-read to provide a more accurate maturity determination that identifies the differences between biologically mature and functionally mature fish as well as to minimize any mis-classified post spawning/recovering fish as skip spawners because of the timing of collection for some samples. While many maturity determinations didn’t change, there were greater uncertainties about whether a fish was post spawning/recovering or post skip spawning. It is possible that errors in previous maturity determinations made it appear that there was a higher rate of skip spawning that was actually occurring. Using the updated analysis, there was more variability length at maturity when the asymptote approaches 1, which appears to look like skip spawning, and that variability was reduced when age at maturity was used because ages can represent a wide range of lengths.  -->

#### Fecundity

Fecundity was fixed at the parameter values from the meta-analysis in
[@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. Existing species specific fecundity
information for canary rockfish is limited and only 9 samples of canary
rockfish exist within the rockfish fecundity database housed at the
\gls{sefsc} (S. Beyer, personal communication, May 22, 2023, University
of Washington). [@dick_meta-analysis_2017] performed their analysis on
subgenera with at least three species, which excluded canary rockfish,
so the relationship in [@dick_meta-analysis_2017] for general *Sebastes*
species was used for this assessment. Fecundity was assumed as a power
function of length, as in [@dick_meta-analysis_2017], whereas the
previous assessment assumed fecundity was linearly proportional to
weight and used parameter estimates from [@dick_modeling_2009]. Although
these reflect different parameterizations, they are transferrable based
on the weight-length relationship. The fecundity relationship for this
assessment was
`r paste0('$', format(model$FecPar1, scientific = TRUE), 'L^{', round(model$FecPar2,2), '}$')`
in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. The new relationship
results in a decrease in fecundity at larger sizes compared to the
relationship used in the 2015 assessment (Figure
\ref{fig:compare_fecundity}).

### Steepness

Steepness is defined as the proportion of average recruitment for an
unfished population that is expected for a population with 20% of
unfished spawning output. It represents a measure of compensation in the
spawner-recruit relationship. It is typically difficult to estimate
using data for a single population (Conn et al., 2010), which has led to
a series of meta-analyses to estimate its likely value (Dorn, 2002;
Myers et al., 1995).

Steepness in this assessment was fixed at the prior mean value. The
SSC-approved prior for steepness in 2023 assumes a beta distribution
with a mean of 0.72 and standard deviation of 0.16
[@pfmc_accepted_2023]. The prior parameters are based on the
Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish
assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC,
NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical
Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently
rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted
in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method
for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the
previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

### Length-Weight Relationship

```{r include=FALSE}
library(here)
w.l <- read.csv(here('data/W_L_pars.csv'))
```

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the
model using available coastwide biological data collected from the
\gls{s-wcgbt}. This included `r w.l$n[w.l$Sex=='F']` females and
`r w.l$n[w.l$Sex=='M']` males. The estimated length-weight relationship
for `r spp` was
`r paste0('$W =', format(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen1[1], scientific = TRUE), 'L^{', round(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen2[1],2), '}$')`
for females and
`r paste0('$W =', format(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen1[2], scientific = TRUE), 'L^{', round(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen2[2],2), '}$')`
for males, where $L$ is fork length in cm and $W$ is weight in kg
(Figure \ref{fig:WL}). The curve was fit as a linear model in log space
and then corrected for lognormal bias. The relationship is similar to
the relationship used in the previous 2015 benchmark assessment and
indicates that male and female `r spp` have similar length-weight
relationships (Figure \ref{fig:compare_WL}).

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

`r Spp` display sexually dimorphic growth. Females grow slower and
obtain larger sizes than males. Recent research also indicates that
`r spp` growth varies latitudinally [@keller2018canary;
@Brooks_thesis_2021]. Using \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-hkl} data and
considering breakpoints at the biogeographic boundaries of Point
Conception and Cape Mendocino, Keller et al. [-@keller2018canary] found
growth differences that were statistically significant but inconsistent
across sexes. However, the bulk of the `r spp` population, and
particularly the bulk of older individuals needed to reliably estimate a
growth curve, are found north of Cape Mendocino. More consistent with
theory, Brooks [-@Brooks_thesis_2021] found that individuals of both
sexes tended to grow slower and to larger sizes farther north, with a
break point estimated between Coos Bay, OR and Newport, OR based on data
from samples collected in untrawlable habitat, with similar numbers
coming from each major port along the coast. We explored estimating two
growth curves external to the assessment model split at Coos Bay, OR,
but using the more expansive \gls{s-wcgbt} data (1567 vs.
`r sum(wcgbts.summary[,'N ages'])` samples; maximum age of 51 vs. 65).
Results indicated that although individuals captured north of Coos Bay
did grow to slightly larger sizes than those captured south of Coos Bay,
particularly female individuals, the differences were biologically minor
and did not warrant the additional complexity in the stock assessment
model (Figure \ref{fig:spatial_AL}). Thus, growth was assumed constant
across the coast, as was assumed in the 2015 benchmark assessment.
Externally estimated von-Bertalanffy growth parameters for
`r spp` using \gls{s-wcgbt} data were as follows: $L_\infty$ = 57.9 cm and $k$ =
0.143 for females with length at age
1 equal to 11.38 cm, and $L_\infty$ = 51.3 cm and $k$ = 0.175 for males with length at age 1
equal to 11.36 cm. We therefore assume size
of young males and females are identical, consistent with the
assumptions in the 2015 bechmark assessment. 
<!-- **We didn't do this** These estimates were used as initial values within the base model for estimating growth. -->


### Sex Ratio

As described in the mortality section, the observed sex ratio is skewed
towards males at older ages (Figure \ref{fig:sex_ratio_age}). Sex ratio
based on length is skewed towards females at larger sizes due to the
sexually dimorphic growth (Figure \ref{fig:sex_ratio_length}). A cursory
look at sex ratios within the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} by latitude
indicate that males and females are similarly dispersed coastwide, and
that differences in sex ratios at age are not due to latitudinal or
depth specific differences (Figure
\@ref(fig:biology-sexratio-lengthbylatitude)), and thus, a sex ratio of
50:50 was assumed for this assessment, as was done in the 2015 benchmark
assessment. **TODO: Figure**

### Ageing Precision and Bias

The ageing error matrices used in the 2015 benchmark assessment for
break and burn samples were retained for this analysis. Ageing error was
explored in the 2015 assessment including extensive model selection and
exploration on the ageing methods to includes and the appropriate aging
lab to treat as unbiased [@thorson_status_2015]. An extensive
description on the history of including ageing error and bias into past
canary assessments was also provided in the 2015 asessment
[@thorson_status_2015]. Surface read ages were not included in this
assessment and therefore surface read ageing error matrices from the
2015 assessment were not retained in the model.

Per the 2015 assessment, ages from the CAPS ageing laboratory were
assumed unbiased, and a linear bias for break-and-burn reads from ODFW
and WDFW ageing labs were estimated alongwith a constant coefficient of
variation (CV) for imprecision for break-and-burn reads from CAPS, ODFW,
and WDFW. The estimated pattern for bias and imprecision (*Add figure
here. Jim's figure 37*) indicates that ODFW break-and-burn reads are
almost unbiased relative to CAPS break-and-burn reads, and the WDFW
break-and-burn reads have a positive bias relative to CAPS
break-and-burn reads (+3.76 yrs. at age 30).

A qualitative examination of the new break and burn double reads showed
no evidence that the ageing estimation had changed over time relative to
the samples included in the previous analyses. Furthermore, a new
TMB-based ageing error software has been developed (A. Punt pers. comm.)
but has not yet been fully explored or documented. Therefore, revision
of the ageing error matrices has been left as a research project to be
completed in time for the next full assessment.

*We need to do this qualitative analysis. TO DO: KIVA* *Add figure of
ageing error* *We need to add in the bomb radiocarbon bias to these*

*Do we want to keep in sample size information? Im commenting this out
in part because we dont update so new data numbers are irrelevant*
<!-- In this assessment, we obtain all available double read data and re-estimate bias and imprecision for reads provided by ODFW, WDFW, and CAPS labs using either break-and-burn or surface read techniques.  This includes 2,307 unique otoliths with double-reads primarily among readers at the CAPS laboratory, obtained from P. McDonald (personal communication, Nov. 20, 2014), as well as 6,544 unique otoliths with double-reads between CAPS or ODFW laboratories and the WDFW laboratory, obtained from P. Weyland (personal communication, Dec. 17, 2014).  Exploratory analysis indicated memory problems with the analysis software unless reads were restricted to those aged 60 or younger, and this restriction decreased the total sample size to 8,812 (from 8,851).  All reads were classified by laboratory and reader method, resulting in five unique categories for ageing error:  CAPS break-and-burn (4,991 unique reads); ODFW break-and-burn (2,400 unique reads); WDFW break-and-burn (10,180 unique reads); ODFW surface reads (199 unique reads); and WDFW surface reads (576 unique reads), where the total number of unique reads for each lab exceeds the number of unique otoliths because otoliths are read twice or three times each. -->

## Environmental and Ecosystem Data

This assessment does not include any environmental or ecosystem data.

<!--chapter:end:23enviro.Rmd-->

## Data sources considered but not used


*We should specify what sources of data (catch, lengths, ages, indices) these refer to*

### \gls{s-ccfrp}

The \gls{s-ccfrp} has conducted fishery-independent data collection efforts onboard commercial passenger fishing vessels both inside and outside of MPAs between 2007 and present. Aspects of canary rockfish life history make the data set less than ideal. One important consideration is the limitation of sampling to less than 150 ft to minimize barotrauma for fish released by this hook and line survey, which limits access to the primary depth distribution of adult canary rockfish. In addition, until 2017 the sampling was focused on central California at the southern edge of the species range in California. While additional data has been collected subsequently to better represent the statewide abundance of groundfish stocks, the limited depths sampled and spatial limitations early in the survey further the utility and representativeness of the survey for this northernly distributed stock. Lastly, the high degree of vagility of canary rockfish makes accounting for MPA effects of lesser importance reducing the impetus to account for trends in closed areas for this species.

### Commercial Collection Report System

From 1977-1985 Commercial Collection Report System (CCRS) provided data on commercial passenger fishing vessels sampled at dockside. This study was very limited in spatial scale, focusing efforts on a limited portion of the species range in the Monterey Bay area representing only the southern end of the distribution of canary rockfish. In addition, this region is unique in providing access to deeper depths a short distance from shore along the sub-marine canyons of Monterey and Carmel Bays potentially biasing representation relative to the entire coast north of Point Conception within California where they are commonly found. Though 488 canary rockfish were sampled during the duration of the survey limited geographic representation at the southern edge of the species range and lack of representation from other ports with more distant grounds on the shelf/slope limits the utility of this data and comparability to other data sets.

### Historical CDFW Dockside Sampling

A dockside sampling effort was undertaken by CDFW during the 1950s-1970s to collect data from the private and rental boat and party charter fleets. Data collected from 1958 to 1972 from Miller and Gotshall 1965. Miller and Geibel 1973 and efforts were made to digitize data from sample sites in the Monterey Bay Area from Ano Nuevo to Point Sur. Over the course of the survey, 1032 canary rockfish lengths were collected from party boats and 461 from private boats. The limited geographic representation at the southern edge of the species range and lack of representation from other ports with more distant grounds on the shelf/slope limits the utility of this data and comparability to other data sets.

### Washington Sport Dockside interview data

The WDFW provided recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981 through 2022 for consideration in this assessment. Data were collected at the trip level, with the number of landed fish and the number of anglers on each vessel being recorded. The amount of time fished by each angler was not recorded. The recreational dockside data was considered for use in this assessment, however, management measures implemented over the past several decades impeded extracting a reliable signal for use as abundance indices. In 2003, management restricted summer fishing depths to shallower than 20-fathoms in WDFW marine areas 3 and 4, and in 2006 modified this depth restriction to 30-fathoms in marine areas 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, daily rockfish limits were 15 fish from 1981-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994 (except in area 1 where it remained at 15), 10 fish from 1995-2016, and a reduction to 7 fish from 2017-2022. The effects of these management changes to CPUE of canary rockfish could not be reconciled with changes in the abundance indices and therefore this dataset was not used in this assessment.

### Washington nearshore rod-and-reel survey

Fishery-independent data available for this assessment came from two distinct WDFW research projects. The first was the Rockfish Tagging Program that was initiated in the early 2010s primarily off the central coast of Washington with sparse coverage in the northern and southern coast. The second data set was from the standardized Coastwide Rod-and-Reel Survey that began in 2019. The tagging program had strong focus on black rockfish and had little information for canary. The new nearshore survey was impacted by the COVID pandemic and was not completed as originally designed. Due to their short time spans and spatial coverage limited to Washington waters, these two datasets are not used in this assessment.

### WA olympic coast YOY survey (NOAA)

Dive surveys represent a promising data source for `r spp` as their habitat preferences for rocky untrawlable habitat means they are poorly sampled by NMFS trawl surveys. However, this seven-year dataset covering juvenile rockfish habitat (2015-2022, missing 2020) contained three years without any canary observations, and only covers the northern Washington coast. Due to limited sample sizes and coverage of only a small fraction of the assessed area, this dataset was deemed insufficient for inclusion in the assessment. Future research could synthesize dive surveys from throughout the range of canary to build a more robust recruitment index post-density dependence that may be more appropriate for inclusion in an assessment. 

### Oregon indices

Two indices of relative abundance were developed for canary rockfish in Oregon using the \gls{sdmtmb} package, but ultimately not included in the base model.  Given the period of non-retention for canary rockfish, the only viable fishery-dependent index was based on onboard sampling of charter vessels that includes both retained and released fish.  Additionally, a second index from Oregon’s marine reserve hook and line survey was also developed.

### \gls{s-hkl}

This survey operates south of Point Conception, whereas `r spp` density decreases substantially after that major biogeographic barrier. CITE MAP OF WCGBTS TOWS. Thus, this survey does not cover the main spatial range of the stock and was not considered representative.

### \gls{iphc} survey

This survey caught 178 canary rockfish over 23 years, and thus was deemed insufficient for developing an index.

## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Modeling Platform and Structure

<!-- First part of TOR Appendix B E.5 -->

*Brian has updated this section*

We used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.21, compiled February 10, 2023 by
Rick Methot at the \gls{noaa} \gls{nwfsc} using the 64-bit version of
ADMB 13.1 [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version includes
improvements and corrections to older model versions. The previous
benchmark assessment used an older version of Stock Synthesis, version
3.24V. The R package r4ss, version 1.48.0, along with R version 4.2.2
were used to investigate and plot model fits.

### Balance of realism and parsimony

<!-- First part of TOR Appendix B F.2 -->

*Brian has updated this section*

*Kiva: suggest moving this down to be more in line with where it falls in the TOR, with base model selection*

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony
and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory
for the population of `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast. The model
contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different
sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model
runs were done to achieve the final base model, some of which are
described as sensitivities (Section \ref{sensitivities}) and some of
which are included in the bridging steps described below. Notably, we
simplify the population structure of the model by assuming a single
coastwide stock, yet increase spatial fleet structure by unmirroring
fleet selectivities between states. We balance the increased complexity
in spatial fleet structure by simplifying the selectivity
parameterization by combining fleets and minimizing the use of blocks
where able to balance tradeoffs in realism and parsimony.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

<!-- TOR Appendix B E.4 I like it better here because the logic flows better-->

**Need to do**

1.  *Remove survey catches*
2.  *Remove surface read ages*
3.  *Simplify population structure*
4.  *Unmirror selectivity for fleets*
5.  *Remove fleets with limited contributions (e.g. CA rec ages, CA
    ASHOP comps)*
6.  *Natural mortality structure constant*
7.  *Selectivity structure sex-dependent*
8.  *Shrimp trawl as trawl gear*
9.  *Reorganize FOR catches by INPFC area*
10. \*Update life history set up (e.g. using Linf instead of Length at
    30) but probably specify this is structure\*

### Bridging analysis from the 2015 Benchmark Assessment

<!-- TOR Appendix B F.1 -->

*Brian has updated this section*

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2015 benchmark
assessment model to the newest version of Stock Synthesis, version
3.30.21. Using the newest Stock Synthesis version resulted in a slightly
lower spawning output starting around 1995 (Figures
\ref{fig:bridge-exe-bio} and \ref{fig:bridge-exe-relbio}) due to a
higher value of catchability for the Washington late triennial survey.
From there, bridging from the 2015 benchmark assessment model to the
current base model followed five general steps:

1.  Update data inputs to reflect best information currently available.
    Data was updated by source (fishery independent, fishery
    independent) and type (catch, compositions, indices).
2.  Update life history information including natural mortality value
    and pattern, maturity, steepness, fecundity, and weight-length
    relationship.
3.  Update the structure of the modeled population, going from a spatial
    structure for recruitment to a single-area structure for
    recruitment.
4.  Reapply current data weighting practices.
5.  Update structure of selectivity.

A thorough description of the current base model is presented separately
below. This section is intended only to more clearly identify where
substantive changes were made from the previous benchmark assessment.
Sensitivities to many of the components within the steps above are
included in the Sensitivities (Section \ref{sensitivities}).

Changes due to updating data streams are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:bridge-data-bio} and \ref{fig:bridge-data-relbio}. Updating the
fishery catch and composition data increases initial spawning output and
produces a steady increase in recent spawning output. Updating survey
indices and composition data results in a decreasing trend in spawning
output in the most recent years. Changes in life history parameter
values are shown in Figures \ref{fig:bridge-bio-bio} and
\ref{fig:bridge-bio-relbio}. Individually these changes produce
different estimates for initial spawning output, but collectively offset
and result in continuing the trajectory from the 2015 benchmark
assessment.

Changes due to altering the structure of natural mortality are
substantial (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-Mcons-bio} and
\ref{fig:bridge-Mcons-relbio}). Assuming constant natural mortality
results in similar parameter estimates for male and female natural
mortality, and reduces the degree of recovery in spawning output
relative to unfished, as also shown within sensitivities from the 2015
benchmark assessment. Also similar to the findings from the 2015
benchmark assessment, changing the structure of the population from
spatial to non-spatial resulted in small changes in the current model
(Figures \ref{fig:bridge-spatial-bio} and
\ref{fig:bridge-spatial-relbio}). Updating the data weighting process to
current standard weighting practices and to account for the new updated
data however resulted in a decrease in the degree of recovery in
spawning output relative to unfished.

Changes in how selectivity was modeled are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:bridge-selex-bio} and \ref{fig:bridge-selex-relbio}. Allowing
selectivity to be sex-dependent had a large change in the degree of
recovery in spawning output relative to unfished, due to an increase in
the estimated value of female natural mortality. Other changes in
selectivity including unmirroring fleets and using alternative
parameterizations resulted in small changes.

To arrive at a final base model additional revisions to the fleet
structure, weightings, selectivity blocks, and selectivity
parameterizations were made after the five aforementioned steps in order
to determine the best fit to the data.

### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

<!-- Move section from below to match later part TOR Appendix B E.5 and TOR Appendix B F.2 and -->

#### Definition of fleets and areas

*Kiva has updated this*

To foster comparability between the coast-wide base model and a
state-stratified model more similar to the 2015 base model, we retain
state-specific fleets for each fleet type from the 2015 assessment. All
fleets are ordered from south to north. That is, fleet 1 is California
trawl, fleet 2 Oregon trawl, and fleet 3 Washington trawl.

Fleets in the base model include:

1-3. Trawl -- Bottom trawl gears, including shrimp trawl and mid-water
trawl.

4-6. Non-trawl -- The non-trawl fleet includes a variety of sources of
directed and bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries.

7-9. Recreational -- Including both private-rental and party-charter
catches.

10-12. At-sea hake -- The at-sea hake fleet includes both tribal and
non-tribal at-sea hake fisheries.

13-15. Foreign -- The foreign fleet operated 1966-1976, and does not
generally include any data regarding catch rates, length composition, or
age composition. We assume that the foreign fleet has selectivity equal
to that of trawl fleet.

28. WCGBTS

29. Triennial early -- because canary rockfish sampling should be
    minimally impacted by the changes in the triennial survey that
    occurred in 1998, we chose to mirror selectivity and catchability
    between the early and late triennial fleets, but maintain two fleets
    to explore sensitivity to this assumption.

30. Triennial late -- The triennial late fleets include years 1998-2004.

31. Pre-recruit

The following state-stratified fleets were retained from 2015 and had
data updated to 2022 for comparison between the base model and a current
spatial model, but do not appear in the likelihood in the base model:

16-18. State-stratified WCGBTS

19-21. State-stratified triennial early

22-24. State-stratified triennial late

25-27. State-stratified pre-recruit

#### Initialization of the model

*Kiva has updated this*

We start the model in the first year of reconstructed catch data, i.e.,
1892. The population is assumed to experience no fishing mortality prior
to this year, and to start in stable age-distribution. Early recruitment
deviations are estimated starting in the first model year (1892), and
main period recruitment deviations begin in 1960 and end in 2022, as
justified previously.

### Model Parameters

<!-- second half of TOR Appendix B E.6 -->

#### Model likelihood components

*Kiva has updated this but it needs a couple internal references.*

The model contains four primary likelihood components (see Table
REFERENCE): 1. Fit to survey indices of abundance (included for fleets
28-31) 2. Fit to length composition samples (included for fleets 1-12
and 28-30, i.e., all fishing fleets except the foreign fleet and the
coast-wide \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri}), 3. Fit to age composition
samples (marginal ages are included for fisheries, i.e., fleets 1-6 and
8-12, and conditional age-at-length samples are included for surveys,
i.e., fleets 28-30).\
4. Penalties on recruitment deviations which range from 1892-2014.

Indices of abundance are assumed to exhibit lognormal measurement
errors, where the log-standard deviation from the model used to
standardize the relevant survey data is treated as an accurate estimate
of measurement errors. Length, marginal age, and conditional age at
length samples are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling
distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size
calculated during compositional expansion, and where this input sample
size is subsequently downweighted to account for additional sources of
overdispersion. Recruitment deviations are assumed to follow a lognormal
distribution, where the standard deviation of this distribution is tuned
as explained in section WHERE.

#### Data weighting

Given the estimated standard errors for abundance indices and estimated
input sample sizes for compositional data, Stock Synthesis weights each
data source according to its contribution to the joint likelihood
(Francis, 2011). However, there are two problems with using these input
sample sizes: 1. Input sample size may not accurately reflect additional
process errors caused, e.g., by unmodeled spatial variation and
aggregation among fishes of different size or length classes (Thorson,
2014). 2. Fishes that are sampled for age are generally also included in
any length composition sampling protocol. Therefore, including both
marginal length and marginal age composition may "double count" the same
fish, and this double-counting is problematic whenever there is a strong
association between length and age (i.e., the two variables are
correlated).

We deal with the second concern in the following manner. Assume a fleet
has an expanded sample size n for length composition samples, and an
expanded sample size m for age composition samples. We treat n2/(n+m) as
the input sample size for length compositions, and m2/(n+m) as the input
sample size for age compositions. We deal with the first concern by
subsequently decreasing these input sample sizes to account for the
match between expected and observed compositional data (i.e., to account
for overdispersed errors). We specifically use a new Francis weighting
method that is implemented in r4ss. The Francis method computes the
additional variance which is necessary to ensure that the standard
deviation in average length/age in the sample matches the expected
standard deviation in length/age in the portion of the population that
is available to that fleet. In a later section, we compare alternative
treatments of data weighting to illustrate that results are relatively
insensitive to data-weighting decisions.

We also explored the use of Dirichlet-multinomial data weighting for
compositional data, which is appealing as it conducts the data weighting
internally by estimating additional model parameters and does not
require additional tuning runs [@thorson_model-based_2017]. However,
Dirichlet-multinomial weighting has not been simulation tested on
assessments containing length composition data. Nearly all data weights
for both lengths and ages were estimated close to one. This was deemed
implausible and it was not explored further.

#### Constraints on parameters

*Kiva has updated this, with one question to Brian in final paragraph*

We fix many parameters representing the yield curve for canary rockfish,
given that we have little confidence in our ability to freely estimate
this curve internally to the model. Specifically, we fix stock-recruit
steepness ($h=0.72$) and natural mortality rate for males ($M=0.0643$
yr$^{-1}$). We do estimate the female natural mortality rate, as well as
parameters representing growth (k and Linf for males and females) and
variability in growth. Thus, some, but not all parameters that govern
the yield curve are estimated [@mangel2013perspective].

We include an informative prior on female natural mortality
[lognormal(-2.74, 0.31); @hamel2022development] and penalties on
recruitment deviations and deviations in the distribution of
recruitment, which can be interpreted as hyperpriors (where the variance
of the "hyperprior," $\sigma_R=0.5$, is fixed).

Selectivity is allowed to be dome-shaped for all surveys and fisheries.
The foreign fishery does not have length or age composition samples are
not available, and is mirrored to have identical selectivity to the
domestic trawl fishery. We specify that commercial trawl selectivity is
shared between Oregon and Washington due to similar composition data and
the fact that many vessels cross the border while fishing and then
return to home ports to land their catch. *Brian do you want do add
something here about changes in likelihood?* These landings and,
particularly, composition data that is caught off of the coast of one
state and landed in the other is difficult to disentangle. Finally, we
specify that selectivity for the at-sea hake fleet is shared among all
three states.

#### Stock Recruitment function

*Kiva updated this, but second paragraph needs comments on tuning, which I did not do.*

We approximate recruitment by estimating deviations around a
Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship. We fix steepness, representing
the magnitude of compensation in the stock-recruit relationship, at the mean of the
SSC-approved prior for rockfishes, 0.72, and freely
estimate the average magnitude of unfished recruitment, ln(R0).
Deviations around the stock-recruit relationship are penalized towards
zero. Early deviations are estimated from the beginning of the model period until 1960 in order to fully propagate uncertainty in recruitment and allow population age-structure to represent plausible deviations from the equilibrium at the start of composition data. Main phase recruitment deviations are estimated beginning in 1960, shortly before composition data becomes available in 1968. Deviations during the "main" period are
specified to sum to zero, such that the stock-recruit relationship can
be interpreted as the mean of deviations during this period. The year
1960 was selected as the year at which annual deviations became
well-informed by compositional data.

*Brian, I did not tune sigma R. Did you?*

The magnitude of recruitment deviations ($\sigma_R$) is tuned to approximate their treatment as random
effects. Specifically, they are tuned to ensure that they approximately
equal the square-root of the sample variance of deviations plus the
average squared-standard error of estimated deviations. Previous
research indicates that this is a reasonable approximation to their
estimation via maximum marginal likelihood when treating recruitment
deviations as a random effect [@methot_adjusting_2011]. Tuning results in the value $\sigma_R = 0.5$. Given this values,
we then estimate bias-adjustment for recruitment deviations using a
bias-adjustment ramp estimated using the R-package `r4ss`.

#### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

*Kiva: this does not look like it is in the TOR. I suggest deleting so we don't have to update, and reviewers don't have to read. I think there is plenty of discussion elsewhere on "key assumptions and structural choices"*

We note two critical assumptions that are implied by our use of a
spatial model: 1. Low or no movement: The base model assumes that there
is no movement after the settlement of age-0 juveniles. We explore the
impact of low rates of adult movement in a later sensitivity analysis
(Figure 117).

2.  Accurate assignment of fishery landings among states: The base model
    drives differences in population status among states by spatial
    variation in recruitment (estimated using deviations in the spatial
    distribution of recruitment) and by variation in exploitation
    history among states. This exploitation history is estimated by
    allocating reconstructed landings by stratum. In particular, data
    regarding fishery harvest is available by landed port. We have
    assumed that the quantity of fish landed in a given stratum (e.g.,
    46-49 N) is a close approximation to the quantity caught within that
    stratum. We evaluate the consequences of this assumption in a
    sensitivity analysis that compares performance with a nonspatial
    model (Figure 40).

## Base Model Results

**Brian is working on this section - just need to do fits to data**

### Parameter Estimates

*Ensure WL1 for male and female and eggs scalar are sceientific method*
*Set priors of unestimated values to -99 uniformly*
*Remove the triennial late line as its mirrored*

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors (SD column) are shown in Table \@ref{tab:params}. This table enumerates a total of 241 estimated parameters. These include one parameter for $R_0$, one parameter for female natural mortality, 10 parameters describing growth, one parameter for survey catchability in the \gls{s-tri}, one parameter for extra variability for the pre-recruit survey, 71 parameters for length-based selectivity and block along with 25 parameters for sex-dependent selectivity, and 131 recruitment deviations.

#### Biology parameters

The estimates of growth parameters by sex varied relative to the externally estimated starting values (Table \ref{tab:params}).  The length-at-age 1 for both sexes were less than the external estimates using the survey age data while the $L_\infty$ estimates for both sexes were higher than the external estimates. The estimated $k$ for females and males was greater than the values estimated externally, with the value for females being more similar. Although estimated growth differed from external estimates, external estimates were within the 95 percent confidence interval (with males near the lower edge) given the estimated uncertainty from the model (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). The coefficition of variation in in growth was assumed to be function of length at age. Although estimates for the coefficient of variation at $L_\infty$ were approximately half those at length-at-age 1 for males and females, which given the estimates for length at older and younger fish, results in greater variability in length at larger sizes. 

####	Selectivity
Length-based selectivity curves were estimated using a double-normal pattern for every fishery and survey, and time-block, except where selectivity was mirrored among fleets. A double-normal selectivity pattern allows flexibility in the model to estimate either asymptotic or dome-shaped selectivity. Estimated selectivity curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:comm-selex-female}--\ref{fig:noncomm-selex-female} for females and Figures \ref{fig:comm-selex-male}--\ref{fig:noncomm-selex-male} for males, with selectivity parameters provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. Nearly all fleets show a strong dome-shaped pattern with the execption of the Oregon and Washington trawl fleet from 2000--2011, the Oregon non-trawl fleet prior to 2000, and the \gls{s-tri}. The amount of unavailable biomass for `r spp` is large in the early time period, declines during the period of peak exploitation, and then increases since 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:unavail-bio}). 
**Add statement about sensitvity to having a full asymptotic fleet to teh above**

For the trawl fleets, the length at peak selectivity is greatest prior to 2000, with the California peak at 46 cm and the mirrored Oregon and Washington peak at 49 cm. Selectivity shifts towards smaller fish in recent time periods between 3--6 cm depending on the fleet and time block. The pattern of dome-ness between time periods is stronger in California in recent years whereas for Oregon and Washington the curve tends to shift towards smaller fish, and to an asymptotic pattern between 2000-2011. The foreign fleets are mirrored to the trawl fleets and have the same selectivity curves. 

For the non-trawl fleets, the patterns in selectivity are more variable, reflecting the sparseness of the compositional data. In California, selectivity for smaller fish than in the trawl fleet, with a peak at 36 cm. The range of lengths selected is more compressed but has shifted towards larger fish by 2 cm in the most recent years compared to before 2000. The selectivity curve has changed the most over time in Oregon. Prior to 2000, the peak in selectivity was 55 cm, lowered to 33 cm in the 2000s, and increased to 45 cm in the most recent period. The Washington non-trawl fleet has sparse data so has constant selectivity across time, and has a peak at 47 cm.  

The at-sea-hake fishery has mirrored selectivity across each state given the similarities in the fishery along the coast. The selectivity is more narrow than either the trawl or non-trawl fleets, with a steep increase around 40 cm and peak at 44 cm. No time-varying selectivity is applied to the at-sea-hake fishery.

For the recreational fishery, the length at peak selectivity is shifted towards smaller fish compared to the commercial fleets. Selectivity increases sharply and reaches a peak of 29 cm in California, 30 cm in Oregon and 34 cm in Washington. For all fleets, selectivity in the earlier time periods is shifted towards smaller fish. Selectivity for Washington shifts greatly in 2021-2022 to a peak of 48 cm, which may be due in part to being the last two years whereas the recent block for other fleets includes earlier years. All recreational fleets show strong dome-ness, with the greatest decline during the period of non-rentention. 

Among surveys, the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} are estimated to have a slowly increasing selectivity curve across  a wide range of lengths; starting at very small sized and increasing to a peak near 43--44cm. This likely reflects the spatial and bathymetric coverage and non-targeting nature of the survey design compared to the fishery. Selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} declines for larger individuals whereas for the \gls{s-tri} selectivity is nearly asymptotic. No time-varying selectivity is applied for the surveys, and the \gls{s-tri} is mirrored across the early and late period.

For all fleets and surveys, male selectivity shows a greater dome-ness than females. This is likely compensating for a lower availability of large females given that their natural mortality estimate is larger than males, as opposed to females being more unavailability to the fishery. Thus, greater selectivity for females allows them to be selectied for at a larger size prorportional to their occurrence in the population, which is less than males due to greater mortality.

**Need o move elsewhere to where we describe model structure. Seems redundant here**
We specifically estimated three parameters for each selectivity curve, including
	1. the minimum length at which selectivity is one (the “peak”), 
	2. the width of the ascending curve for selectivity at lengths less than the peak, 
	3. the width of the descending curve for selectivity at lengths greater than the peak plus the width of the dome.
We additionally estimate a change in selectivity for the trawl and non-trawl fisheries between 1999 and 2000 (reflecting changes in fisher behavior following the declaration of overfished status for canary rockfish in 1999), and another change in selectivity for the trawl fishery between 2010 and 2011 (reflecting a change in fisher behavior following the implementation of individual transferable quotas starting in 2011).  For each break-point change in selectivity, we re-estimate all four parameters.  Hence, there is no information regarding selectivity that is shared among time blocks.

#### Catchability

Catchability for surveys comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years was either analytically solved for the \gls{s-wcgbt} or estimated for the \gls{s-tri}. The \gls{s-tri} was mirrored across the early and late period so catchability was the same. The values for catchability are commensurate with surveys for a species that is partially inaccessible and caught on a subset of tows (Table **add table where percent positive tows goes**). Catchability in regular space was 0.51 for the \gls{s-wcgbt} analytical value and estimated to be 0.24 for the mirrored \gls{s-tri} (Table \ref{tab:params}). Additional fishery and survey index variability, which is process error added directly to each year's input standard deviation for the pre-recruit survey was estimated within the model at 0.464. Fits to other surveys were near enough to confidence intervals of the estimates of the survey such that additional varaibility was not added.

#### Stock-recruit parameters

In this assessment the logarithm of $R_0$ was estimated, while steepness was fixed at its prior mean of 0.72. Lognormal deviations from the standard Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship were estimated from 1892-2022 with a fixed $\sigma_R$ value of 0.5. There is limited information regarding recruitment prior to 1960 but deviations are estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty around the unfished condition to a degree consistent with estimated variability in recruitment. The time series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. The spawner-recruit curve is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}.

Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in the 1960s and continued through 2000. Starting around 2004 recruitment deviations became more consistently negative and were their most negative in 2018. This period corresponds to a period of relatively sparse compositional data. Deviations have increased to average levels since 2018 but these deviations are more uncertain given the few years available to sample these age classes. The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adjust}. This relationship was updated during early model exploration with the final version near to the suggested alternative provided within r4ss such that it was left at the earlier values. 

### Fits to the Data

**need to do fits to data**

### Population Trajectory

Summary time series of population trajectories are provided in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. The estimated spawning output (in billions of eggs) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}, total biomass in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}, spawning output relative to unfished in Figure \ref{fig:depl}, and fishing intensity measured as one minus the spawning potential ratio (1-SPR) in Figure \ref{fig:spr}. Spawning output declines from the 1940s with the increase in harvest (Figure \ref{fig:catches}), stabilizes in the 1970s, and then declines to its lowest point in 1995. Spawning output stabilizes until 2000 when levels increase steadily to recent years with a slowing trend. The estimated total biomass follows the same general trend as observed in spawning output but with a more pronounced decrease from 1980 to 1995 (Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}). The estimated spawning output relative to the unfished equilibrium spawning output was at its lowest (`r round(100*min(model$sprseries$Deplete,na.rm=TRUE), 1)` percent) in 1995 and has since increase to within the precautionary zone at `r round(100*model$current_depletion, 1)` percent in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Population trajectories track the patterns in fishing intensity, where fishing intensity was steadily above that which would produce an SPR of 0.5 starting in the 1960s (Figure \ref{fig:spr}). Fishing intensity has been low since 2000 but has increased to levels near that corresponding to an SPR of 0.5.
