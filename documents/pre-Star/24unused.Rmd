## Data sources considered but not used


*We should specify what sources of data (catch, lengths, ages, indices) these refer to*

### \gls{s-ccfrp}

The \gls{s-ccfrp} has conducted fishery-independent data collection efforts onboard commercial passenger fishing vessels both inside and outside of MPAs between 2007 and present. Aspects of canary rockfish life history make the data set less than ideal. One important consideration is the limitation of sampling to less than 150 ft to minimize barotrauma for fish released by this hook and line survey, which limits access to the primary depth distribution of adult canary rockfish. In addition, until 2017 the sampling was focused on central California at the southern edge of the species range in California. While additional data has been collected subsequently to better represent the statewide abundance of groundfish stocks, the limited depths sampled and spatial limitations early in the survey further the utility and representativeness of the survey for this northernly distributed stock. Lastly, the high degree of vagility of canary rockfish makes accounting for MPA effects of lesser importance reducing the impetus to account for trends in closed areas for this species.

### Commercial Collection Report System

From 1977-1985 Commercial Collection Report System (CCRS) provided data on commercial passenger fishing vessels sampled at dockside. This study was very limited in spatial scale, focusing efforts on a limited portion of the species range in the Monterey Bay area representing only the southern end of the distribution of canary rockfish. In addition, this region is unique in providing access to deeper depths a short distance from shore along the sub-marine canyons of Monterey and Carmel Bays potentially biasing representation relative to the entire coast north of Point Conception within California where they are commonly found. Though 488 canary rockfish were sampled during the duration of the survey limited geographic representation at the southern edge of the species range and lack of representation from other ports with more distant grounds on the shelf/slope limits the utility of this data and comparability to other data sets.

### Historical CDFW Dockside Sampling

A dockside sampling effort was undertaken by CDFW during the 1950s-1970s to collect data from the private and rental boat and party charter fleets. Data collected from 1958 to 1972 from Miller and Gotshall 1965. Miller and Geibel 1973 and efforts were made to digitize data from sample sites in the Monterey Bay Area from Ano Nuevo to Point Sur. Over the course of the survey, 1032 canary rockfish lengths were collected from party boats and 461 from private boats. The limited geographic representation at the southern edge of the species range and lack of representation from other ports with more distant grounds on the shelf/slope limits the utility of this data and comparability to other data sets.

### Washington Sport Dockside interview data

The WDFW provided recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981 through 2022 for consideration in this assessment. Data were collected at the trip level, with the number of landed fish and the number of anglers on each vessel being recorded. The amount of time fished by each angler was not recorded. The recreational dockside data was considered for use in this assessment, however, management measures implemented over the past several decades impeded extracting a reliable signal for use as abundance indices. In 2003, management restricted summer fishing depths to shallower than 20-fathoms in WDFW marine areas 3 and 4, and in 2006 modified this depth restriction to 30-fathoms in marine areas 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, daily rockfish limits were 15 fish from 1981-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994 (except in area 1 where it remained at 15), 10 fish from 1995-2016, and a reduction to 7 fish from 2017-2022. The effects of these management changes to CPUE of canary rockfish could not be reconciled with changes in the abundance indices and therefore this dataset was not used in this assessment.

### Washington nearshore rod-and-reel survey

Fishery-independent data available for this assessment came from two distinct WDFW research projects. The first was the Rockfish Tagging Program that was initiated in the early 2010s primarily off the central coast of Washington with sparse coverage in the northern and southern coast. The second data set was from the standardized Coastwide Rod-and-Reel Survey that began in 2019. The tagging program had strong focus on black rockfish and had little information for canary. The new nearshore survey was impacted by the COVID pandemic and was not completed as originally designed. Due to their short time spans and spatial coverage limited to Washington waters, these two datasets are not used in this assessment.

### Oregon indices

Two indices of relative abundance were developed for canary rockfish in Oregon using the \gls{sdmtmb} package, but ultimately not included in the base model.  Given the period of non-retention for canary rockfish, the only viable fishery-dependent index was based on onboard sampling of charter vessels that includes both retained and released fish.  Additionally, a second index from Oregonâ€™s marine reserve hook and line survey was also developed.
