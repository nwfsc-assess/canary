## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Modeling Platform and Structure

We used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.21, compiled February 10, 2023 by
Rick Methot at the \gls{noaa} \gls{nwfsc} using the 64-bit version of
ADMB 13.1 [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version includes
improvements and corrections to older model versions. The previous
benchmark assessment used an older version of Stock Synthesis, version
3.24V. The R package r4ss, version 1.48.0, along with R version 4.2.2
were used to investigate and plot model fits.

### Balance of realism and parsimony

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony
and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory
for the population of `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast. The model
contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different
sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model
runs were done to achieve the final base model, some of which are
described as sensitivities (Section \@ref{sensitivities}) and some of
which are included in the bridging steps described below. Notably, we
simplify the population structure of the last benchmark assessment model by assuming a single
coastwide stock, yet increase spatial fleet structure by unmirroring
fleet selectivities between states. We balance the increased complexity
in spatial fleet structure by simplifying the selectivity
parameterization and combining fleets and minimizing the use of blocks
where able.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

**I say a lot that sensitivities were done. Need to confirm that is true once sensitivity section is done**

The assessment model structure has been significantly altered from the 2015 benchmark stock assessment [@thorson_status_2016]. The primary change in terms of effects on model results is with the change in modeling of natural mortality. We model natural mortality as sex-dependent and age-invariant which offers a simplified and more biologically believable approach to natural mortality than an increasing linear ramp in female natural mortality. Assumptions to this choice are tested with sensitivities and described in Section \@ref{sensitivities}. 

Another substantial change is in the treatment of spatial structure in the model, both in terms of population spatial structure as well as fishery fleet structure. We simplify modeling the population structure of `r spp` along the U.S. West Coast by assuming a coastwide population, yet increase the spatial complexity of the fishery. This amounts to using an areas-as-fleets approach [@punt_spatial_2019]. Although an areas-as-fleets approach does not account for potential regional differences in depletion, because catches are assumed to act over the entire modeled area, early explorations indicated some instability in the spatial model when unmirroring and expanding selectivity. Through bridging (described below) we show that the change in population structure does not appear to have a large effect on model results, especially relative to other changes in natural mortality and the relative contribution of various data sources to model estimates.  

By reducing complexity in the population structure of the model, we could increase the spatial complexity of the fishery. Spatial fleet dynamics allow the model structure to account for varying selectivity and historical management actions that may have impacted the fishery and the available data in specific ways. Fleets were assumed to have the same selectivity across states in the 2015 assessment. We allowed selectivity estimates to be informed by the dynamics in waters where they fish, although we have mirrored some fleets where we believe it is appropriate to do so. We have also increased the number of selectivity blocks for the non-trawl and recreational fisheries, which we believe is appropriate given the large changes in regulations for `r spp`. Lastly, we have elected to include sex-dependent selectivity, which both improves fits to data, but also allows dynamics between male and female natural mortality to align better with observed sex-ratios. Sensitivities to choice about fleet structure are described in Section \@ref{sensitivities}.

While in general, fleet structure in the base model is more complex than in the 2015 assessment, we simplified our fleets where reasonable. We treated survey fleets as exclusively survey fleets, and did not model the small amount of catches from these surveys. It is not now standard practice to include surveys as fishing fleets in West Coast assessment. We also removed the California at-sea-hake fishery composition data, which was very sparse, and incorrectly assigned to California. 

Data has also been updated for this assessment. The synthesis and treatment of data has been altered for this assessment based on updated best practices and extensive work by \gls{nwfsc} to document, reproduce, and standardize data processing steps, along with extensive work by staff at state agencies and \gls{psmfc} in providing consistent and accurate data in a more easily obtainable manner. Catch time series have been updated according to current best knowledge. States have updated their historical reconstructions, and past issues with catch time series mentioned in the last assessment review process and in subsequent catch only updates have been corrected. Catch time series for the foreign fleets was also repartitioned to state more consistently with patterns observed in the non-foreign fishery. We also assigned data from shrimp trawls as part of the trawl, where for the 2015 assessment they were included within the non-trawl fleets. Available length and age data have been provided using updated and more reproducible approaches. Significant effort was made by the \gls{nwfsc} ageing lab in providing age reads for new and past `r spp`. These allow age composition data for recreational fleets to be included as well as additional years of data for other fishery and survey fleets. Although more age data were available, we elected to remove surface age reads from the model due to known biases in addition to their removal having little effect on model results of the 2015 assessment. Sensitivities to assumptions around data choices are described in Section \@ref{sensitivities}.

Lastly, a number of changes due to updating fixed parameter estimates and prior values were made for this assessment compared to the 2015 assessment. These changes include updates to the steepness prior, natural mortality prior, the fecundity relationship, and a change in maturiy from length-at-biological maturity to functional-age-at-functionl-maturity based on additional work-up of maturity samples by Melissa Head at \gls{nwfsc}. Changes to biological parameters are more completely described in Section \@ref{biology}. The effect of these changes on model results in described below in the bridging analysis.


### Bridging analysis from the 2015 Benchmark Assessment

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2015 benchmark
assessment model to the newest version of Stock Synthesis, version
3.30.21. Using the newest Stock Synthesis version resulted in a slightly
lower spawning output starting around 1995 (Figures
\ref{fig:bridge-exe-bio} and \ref{fig:bridge-exe-relbio}) due to a
higher value of catchability for the Washington late triennial survey.
From there, bridging from the 2015 benchmark assessment model to the
current base model followed five general steps:

1.  Update data inputs to reflect best information currently available.
    Data was updated by source (fishery independent, fishery
    independent) and type (catch, compositions, indices).
2.  Update life history information including natural mortality value
    and pattern, maturity, steepness, fecundity, and weight-length
    relationship.
3.  Update the structure of the modeled population, going from a spatial
    structure for recruitment to a single-area structure for
    recruitment.
4.  Reapply current data weighting practices.
5.  Update structure of selectivity.

A thorough description of the current base model is presented separately
below. This section is intended only to more clearly identify where
substantive changes were made from the previous benchmark assessment.
Sensitivities to many of the components within the steps above are
included in the Sensitivities (Section \@ref{sensitivities}).

Changes due to updating data streams are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:bridge-data-bio} and \ref{fig:bridge-data-relbio}. Updating the
fishery catch and composition data increases initial spawning output and
produces a steady increase in recent spawning output. Updating survey
indices and composition data results in a decreasing trend in spawning
output in the most recent years. Changes in life history parameter
values are shown in Figures \ref{fig:bridge-bio-bio} and
\ref{fig:bridge-bio-relbio}. Individually these changes produce
different estimates for initial spawning output, but collectively offset
and result in continuing the trajectory from the 2015 benchmark
assessment.

Changes due to altering the structure of natural mortality are
substantial (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-Mcons-bio} and
\ref{fig:bridge-Mcons-relbio}). Assuming constant natural mortality
results in similar parameter estimates for male and female natural
mortality, and reduces the degree of recovery in spawning output
relative to unfished, as also shown within sensitivities from the 2015
benchmark assessment. Also similar to the findings from the 2015
benchmark assessment, changing the structure of the population from
spatial to non-spatial resulted in small changes in the current model
(Figures \ref{fig:bridge-spatial-bio} and
\ref{fig:bridge-spatial-relbio}). Updating the data weighting process to
current standard weighting practices and to account for the new updated
data however resulted in a decrease in the degree of recovery in
spawning output relative to unfished.

Changes in how selectivity was modeled are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:bridge-selex-bio} and \ref{fig:bridge-selex-relbio}. Allowing
selectivity to be sex-dependent had a large change in the degree of
recovery in spawning output relative to unfished, due to an increase in
the estimated value of female natural mortality. Other changes in
selectivity including unmirroring fleets and using alternative
parameterizations resulted in small changes.

To arrive at a final base model additional revisions to the fleet
structure, weightings, selectivity blocks, and selectivity
parameterizations were made after the five aforementioned steps in order
to determine the best fit to the data.

### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

#### Definition of fleets and areas

To foster comparability between the coastwide base model and a
state-stratified model more similar to the 2015 base model, we retain
state-specific fleets for each fleet type from the 2015 assessment, with the exception of survey fleets which are coastwide. All
fleets are ordered from south to north. That is, fleet 1 is California
trawl, fleet 2 Oregon trawl, and fleet 3 Washington trawl, etc..

Fleets in the base model include:

1-3. Trawl -- Bottom trawl gears, including shrimp trawl and mid-water
trawl.
4-6. Non-trawl -- The non-trawl fleet includes a variety of sources of
directed and bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries.
7-9. Recreational -- Including both private-rental and party-charter modes.
10-12. At-sea hake -- The at-sea hake fleet includes both tribal and
non-tribal at-sea hake fisheries. 
13-15. Foreign -- The foreign fleet operated 1966-1976, and does not
generally include any data regarding composition data. We assume that the foreign fleet has selectivity equal
to that of trawl fleet.
28. \gls{s-wcgbt}
29. \gls{s-tri} early -- because canary rockfish sampling should be
    minimally impacted by the changes in the triennial survey that
    occurred in 1995, we chose to mirror selectivity and catchability
    between the early (1980--1992) and late triennial (1995--2004) fleets, but maintain two fleets
    to explore sensitivity to this assumption.
30. \gls{s-tri} late
31. Pre-recruit survey

The following state-stratified survey fleets were retained from 2015 in the model files and had
data updated to 2022 for comparison between the base model and a current
spatial model, but do not appear in the likelihood in the base model nor elsewhere in this report:

16-18. State-stratified WCGBTS
19-21. State-stratified triennial early
22-24. State-stratified triennial late
25-27. State-stratified pre-recruit

#### Initialization of the model

We start the model in the first year of reconstructed catch data, i.e.,
1892. The population is assumed to experience no fishing mortality prior
to this year, and to start in a stable age-distribution. Early recruitment
deviations are estimated starting in the first model year (1892), and
main period recruitment deviations begin in 1960 and end in 2022.

#### Conditional age at length data {#caal}

Age-frequency data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} were compiled as conditional age-at-length distributions by sex and year. The approach consists of tabulating the sums within rows as the standard length-frequency distribution and, instead of also tabulating the sums to the age margin, instead the distribution of ages in each row of the age-length key is treated as a separate observation, conditioned on the row (length) from which it came. 

This approach has several benefits for analysis above the standard use of marginal age compositions. First, age structures are generally collected as a subset of the fish that have been measured. If the ages are to be used to create an external age-length key to transform the lengths to ages, then the uncertainty due to sampling and missing data in the key are not included in the resulting age-compositions used in the stock assessment. The second major benefit to using conditional age-composition observations is that in addition to being able to estimate the basic growth parameters inside the assessment model, the distribution of lengths at a given age that is usually controlled by the CV of length at some young age and the CV at a much older age, are also more reliably estimated. This information could only be derived from marginal age-composition observations where very strong and well-separated cohorts existed, and that arre quite accurately aged and measured; rare conditions at best. By fully estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model, bias due to size-based selectivity is avoided, and known sources of variation are included when estimating growth parameters.

### Model Parameters

#### Model likelihood components

The model contains four primary likelihood components: 

1. Fit to survey indices of abundance (included for fleets 28-31).
2. Fit to length composition samples (included for fleets 1-12 with the exception of fleet 10, and fleets 28-30, i.e., all fishing fleets except the foreign fleets, California at-sea-hake, and the pre-recruit survey).
3. Fit to age composition samples (marginal ages are included for fisheries, i.e., fleets 1-6 and 8-9, and 11-12, and conditional age-at-length samples are included for surveys, fleets 28-30).
4. Penalties on recruitment deviations which range from 1892-2022 as well as penalties from prior likelihoods for parameters estimated with prior distributions.

Indices of abundance are assumed to exhibit lognormal measurement errors, where the log-standard deviation from the model used to standardize the relevant survey data is treated as an accurate estimate of measurement errors. Length, marginal age, and conditional-age-at- length samples are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size for the composition data, and where this input sample size is subsequently weighted to account for additional sources of overdispersion. Recruitment deviations are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, where the standard deviation of this distribution is set to be 0.5. Priors for select biological parameters are described below. 

#### Data weighting

Length and age composition data for the commercial fleets started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Section \@ref{comm-composition-data}. The exception to this was for the at-sea-hake fishery where input sample sizes were based on the number of hauls. Input sample size for length and age composition data for the recreational fishery was determined based on the number of estimated trips (described in Section \@ref{rec-composition-data}). Length composition data for the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} were based on input sample sizes calculated as a multiple of the number of tows (described in Section \@ref{survey-composition-data} and conditional-age-at-length input sample sizes were set equal to the number of ages within a given length bin.

The base model was weighted using the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in [@francis_data_2011] as this method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution) and is widely used among West Coast stock assessments. **TO DO: need to confirm this text is true before adding: 'which was selected based on model stability and consistency to identify the minimum likelihood estimate (MLE)'.** This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be weighted, and typically is down-weighted. We applied four iterations of the Francis method when data-weighting, which resulted in converged estiamtes. The weighting of both the length and age composition was allowed to exceed 1.0, and confirmed that data sources that were upweighted did not have a weighted sample size above the number of fish sampled. Weights for conditional-age-at-length data, which were a direct count of the number of available ages, were all less than one.

Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in the model fits and results due to weighting using the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weighting [@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method are described in Section(\@ref{sensitivities}). We also explored the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting [@thorson_model-based_2017], which is appealing because it conducts the data weighting internally by estimating one additional model parameter per data type and source and does not require additional iterations. However, Dirichlet-multinomial weighting has not been thoroughly simulation tested, and nearly all data weights for both lengths and ages were estimated close to one. This was deemed implausible and the method was not explored further.

#### Priors and constraints on parameters

Priors were used for fixed parameter values for male natural mortality and steepness in the base model, as well as for the estimated parameter value for female natural mortality. Details on the choice and value of priors for these parameters are described in Section \@ref{biology} for natural mortality and steepness and are not repeated here. We model recruitment deviations around the stock-recruit relationship which are penalized towards zero with standard deviation of $\sigma_R = 0.5$ and have the requirement to sum to one. Other than these parameters and those that are fixed, we do not include any other informative priors or constraints on parameters. 

#### Selectivity assumptions

Length-based selectivity is allowed to be dome-shaped for all surveys and fisheries. Selectivity curves were estimated using a double-normal pattern for every fishery and survey, except where selectivity was mirrored among fleets. A double-normal selectivity pattern allows flexibility in the model to estimate either asymptotic or dome-shaped selectivity. 

We specifically estimated three parameters for each selectivity curve, including:

1. Parameter 1: the minimum length at which selectivity is one (i.e. the "peak").
2. Parameter 3: the width of the ascending curve for selectivity at lengths less than the peak, which controls the slope at which selectivity approaches the peak.
3. Parameter 4: the width of the descending curve for selectivity at lengths greater than the peak, which controls the slope at which selectivity declines from the peak.
 
The parameter that controls the width over which selectivity is one (parameter 2) was fixed at a low value. Parameters 5 and 6 were set to have selectivity at small sizes start at zero (parameter 5 set to a low value), and allow selectivity for larger sizes to be non-zero and decay according to parameter 4 (parameter 6 set to -999). Setting parameter 6 this way simplifies the selectivity parameters and allows a single parameter to govern the dome-ness of the selectivity shape instead of two.

The foreign fishery does not have length or age composition samples available, and selectivity is mirrored to the domestic trawl fishery for each state. We specify that commercial trawl selectivity is mirrored between Oregon and Washington due to similar composition data and the fact that many vessels cross the border while fishing and then return to home ports to land their catch. These landings and, particularly, composition data that is caught off of the coast of one state and landed in the other is difficult to disentangle. Finally, we specify that selectivity for the at-sea hake fleet is mirrored among all three states.

We additionally allow selectivity to be time-varying for the trawl, non-trawl, and recreational fleets. Time-varying selectivity in the trawl fleet was blocked at 2000 (reflecting changes in fishing behavior following the declaration of overfished status for `r spp` in 2000), and at 2011 (reflecting a change in fishing behavior following the implementation of individual transferable quotas). Time-varying selectivity in the non-trawl fleet was limited by the sparseness of composition data between the period when `r spp` was declared overfished and a couple of years after it was declared rebuilt in 2015. Based on patterns in the data and discussion with state partners about regulation changes we included selectivity blocks for the Oregon and California non-trawl fleets at 2000 and then again at 2019, to reflect the general period of relaxed regulations for the fishery initiated by the rebuilt declaration. The Washington non-trawl fleet had very sparse composition data until 2017, so we elected for parsimony, and did not apply any time blocking for this fleet. Regulations for the recreational fleets across the coast have been variable, based on seasonal or depth closures, and bag limits. Time-blocks were applied to the California recreational fleet in 2004 and again in 2016, corresponding to the imposition and lifting of the most stringent regulations. Time-blocks were applied to the Oregon recreational fleet in 2004 and again in 2014, and for the Washington recreational fleet in 2006 and again in 2020, which corrsponding roughly to the periods were depth restrictions were imposed (for the first block) and again lifted (for the second block). For each break-point change in selectivity, we re-estimate all
three parameters. Sensitivities to selectivity assumptions including the use of a three parameter parameterization, fixing fleets to have asymptotic selectivity, and simplified blocking were explored and are described in Section(\@ref{sensitivities}). 

Early model explorations around structuring natural mortality indicated the data did not support estimating different female natural mortality than fixed male natural mortality when natural mortality was constant across ages. This was somewhat surprising given the observed male-skewed sex-ratios at age among trawl and survey landings. The issue appeared to be lack of support for having young females have higher natural mortality. When age-varying natural mortality was assumed, as done in previous stock assessments for `r spp`, higher values for older female natural mortality were estimated. We found that allowing sex-dependent selectivity in parameter 4, which governs how steeply selectivity declines at larger sizes, the fit to the data improved. Sex-dependence on other selectivity parameters was explored, but parameter 4 had the largest per-parameter improvement in likelihood, and was large enough to warrant the additional number of selecitivity parameters. We therefore estimate sex-dependent selectivity in the base model, modeled as a logarithmic female offset to parameter 4 for fleets and blocks with sex-specific composition data. Sensitivites to excluding sex-dependent selectivity are described in Section (\@ref{sensitivities}). 


#### Stock Recruitment function

In this assessment the logarithm of $R_0$ was estimated, while steepness
was fixed at its prior mean of 0.72. Lognormal deviations from the
standard Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship were estimated from
1892-2022 with a fixed $\sigma_R$ value of 0.5. There is limited
information regarding recruitment prior to 1960 but deviations are
estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty around the
unfished condition to a degree consistent with estimated variability in
recruitment. The early deviations are estimated from the beginning of the model period until 1960 in order to fully propagate uncertainty in recruitment and allow population age-structure to represent plausible deviations from the equilibrium at the start of composition data. Main phase recruitment deviations are estimated beginning in 1960, shortly before composition data becomes available in 1968.
