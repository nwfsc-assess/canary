# Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge substantial input and helpful review from Jim Ianelli (Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, NOAA), Neil Klaer (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), Stuart Reeves (Center for Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Sciences), and Tom Jagielo (consultant).  We also thank D. Waldeck, D. Erickson, and J. DeVore for consultation during the STAR panel.  We particularly thank R. Methot, I. Taylor, A. Punt, and A. Hicks for providing software that greatly facilitated this assessment process, and K. Kristensen and H. Skaug for developing Template Model Builder, which was instrumental for implementing the new geostatistical index standardization software.  We thank J. Field and S. Ralston for processing data from the pre-recruit survey, J. Wallace for pre-processing data from the Pikitch historical discard study, and B. Horness for her attention to detail when vetting and providing access to NWFSC survey data.  We appreciate Vanessa Tuttleâ€™s assistance in accommodating our multiple data requests and sorting out last minute data issues.  Jason Jannot provided WCGOP data and was patient and responsive to our many data questions.  The hard work done by Patrick McDonald and the team of agers at CAP reading canary otoliths and the high quality of data provided was essential to the success of this assessment.  We are grateful to state representatives, Alison Dauble and Phillip Weyland, who provided valuable data for the recreational fishery.    Finally, J. Hastie, J. Cope, I. Stewart, J. DeVore and O. Hamel have been instrumental in helping to identify and navigate important issues during model design and interpretation.
