## Biological Data

\gls{nwfsc}

The stock assessment model requires specifying several life history
parameters from analyses external to the model. These parameters include
the maturity schedule, fecundity (the relationship between female
length/weight and egg production), the natural mortality rate for males,
the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship, the relationship
between individual weight and length, and estimates of error for
determinations of individual age from reading otoliths.

*NEED TO ADD THIS TABLE* Table \ref{tab:growth-tab} shows the
length-at-age, weight-at-age, maturity-at-age, and spawning output (the
product of fecundity and maturity) assumed in the base model.

*Do we want to add sample sizes to these. For the sake of time Im not
included samples sizes, yet other assessments have used these*

### Natural Mortality

Due to an unexplained male-skewed sex ratio at older ages observed
across fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data sources, canary
rockfish natural mortality has been modeled in a number of ways over the
years. @sampson1996canary modeled a linear ramp in female natural
mortality from 0.06 yr$^{-1}$ at age 9 to roughly 0.18 yr$^{-1}$ at age
25, the plus group. In 1999, the ramp was adjusted to be from 0.06 at
age 11 to 0.20 at age 25, and the document contains an extensive review
of life history theory regarding increasing female natural mortality
[@stat1999canary]. @methot2002canary fixed male and young female natural
mortality at 0.06, but estimated an offset for older females, and based
the slope of increasing natural mortality on maturity, not age,
resulting in a non-linear ramp by age. In 2005, that option was no
longer available in stock synthesis, so the assessment approximated the
2001 pattern by using a linear ramp from age 6 to age 14, again
estimating a female offset [@methot2005canary]. This has been the
approach for all canary rockfish assessments since 2005.

The increased ramp in natural mortality was also used in yellowtail
rockfish assessments prior to 2005 with support from
[@tagart_yellowtail_1991] that the senescent mortality hypothesis fit
the fishery age data well, and was a better biological explanation for
the disappearance of older age females than the alternative hypothesis
that the older females were not vulnerable to the fishery. The pattern
of male-skewed sex ratio at older ages has been observed along the U.S.
West Coast in fishery data off Oregon (Rasmussen pers. comm. ODFW) and
Alaska and in black rockfish in addition to canary and yellowtail
rockfishes. Although it has been found in these three semi-pelagic
species, the pattern has not been observed for bocaccio, chilipepper
rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, or dusky rockfishes (in Alaska), which
are also semi-pelagic. However, starting in the 2010's the male-skewed
sex ratio has evened out in fishery data off Oregon (Rasmussen pers.
comm. ODFW). The pattern has remained within the \gls{s-wcgbt} and has
not evened off in recent years.

*Probably add more background maybe if we have time. We have the Brooks
thesis, and then the Sampson paper that offer alternatives but aren't
complete.*

IF USE A BREAKPOINT: In this assessment, we updated the longevity-based
prior for the natural mortality rate for males and young females based
on @hamel2022development, using a maximum age of 84 yrs as was done in
the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015; @love2002rockfishes].
This results in a lognormal prior with a log-mean of -2.74, a
log-standard deviation of 0.31, and a median natural mortality of 0.0643
yr$^{-1}$ (used as the fixed value). Instead of a ramp, which requires
the analyst to select two ages, we used a breakpoint, which only
requires selecting a single age and is thus more parsimonious. Rather
than placing the breakpoint around the point of 50 percent maturity, at
which point there is little evidence in the data of sex ratios deviating
from 50:50, we placed the breakpoint between ages 20 and 21. This means
female mortality stayed at the low value for more years than in recent
assessments, and is more aligned with where the ratio of females begins
to decline in survey data.

IF USE A SINGLE VALUE: In this assessment, we elected to model natural
mortality for males and females separately. We updated the
longevity-based prior for the natural mortality rate for males and
females based on @hamel2022development, using a maximum age of 84 yrs as
was done in the previous assessment [@thorson_status_2015;
@love2002rockfishes]. This results in a lognormal prior with a log-mean
of -2.74, a log-standard deviation of 0.31, and a median natural
mortality of 0.0643 yr$^{-1}$ for both sexes. As was done in the
previous assessments, we fixed the male natural mortality value at the
prior and estimate female natural mortality. The same maximum age for
males and females was used. Estimating separate male and female natural
mortality removes the need for a user-selected breakpoint at which
natural mortality changes, and has been done in the past assessments for
yellowtail [@stephens_status_2017] and black rockfish for Washington and
California [@cope_assessments_2016].

### Maturation and Fecundity

#### Maturity

We estimate the maturity schedule using available histological
measurements from female ovaries. This includes 163 samples collected by
\gls{odfw} and \gls{wdfw} during winter (October--February) in 2014,
2015, and 2016; and 527 ovaries collected during the \gls{s-wcgbt} in
2009--2016 across a range of depths (57--222 m) and latitudes
(35.7--48.3$^\circ N$) and 53 collected during the \gls{s-hkl} between
2009--2022.

We use functional maturity rather than biological maturity as the
measure of maturity in this assessment. Rockfish begin the process of
maturing several years before they reach spawning potential. Thus
biological maturity would indicate that yolk is present but not that the
fish is spawning capable. Juveniles in abortive maturation and adults in
skip spawning would be marked as biologically mature but functionally
immature. Biological maturity indicates the fish was putting energy
reserves toward spawning, but not necessarily spawning capable for the
year; while functional maturity captures the actual spawners.

We estimate maturity in this assessment using age at maturity. Not all
histological samples included ages, so a total of 777 samples were used
for estimating age at maturity. We assume age at maturity follows a
two-parameter logistic regression model with an asymptote at 1 based on
the findings of [@head_maturity_2016] and fits to histological samples.
Parameters were fixed in the model at estimates from the logistic
regression, and were
`r paste0('$A_{50\\%} =', round(model$Growth_Parameters$Mat1[1], 2), '$')`
and slope
`r paste0('$\\alpha =', round(model$Growth_Parameters$Mat2[1], 2), '$')`.
This relationship is an improvement to the maturity curve used in the
previous assessment, as it uses functional maturity instead of
biological maturity. This, in addition to the use of age instead of
length, eliminated the need for a third parameter in the maturity curve
estimating the probability of skip spawning. Due to the relatively steep
growth curve of `r spp`, a given length can represent a wide range of
ages. The new relationship results in a rightward shift in maturity and
increase in maturity at older ages compared to the relationship derived
within the 2015 assessment (Figure \ref{fig:compare_maturity}). 
*TO DO:add data to figure*

*Text that melissa provided is below but simplified. This may be too
detailed. Dont have to defend the previous assessment KLO: I took the
key points from this and moved them into the paragraph above. I think
reviewers will appreciate conciseness, but feel free to edit further.*
<!-- The previous assessments used length at maturity modeled as a three parameter logistic which allowed an asymptote less than 1 to account for occurrence of skip spawning [@thorson_status_2015]. Previous maturity results were based on maturity estimates similar to biological maturity. Maturity was defined if yolk or more advanced stages of maturity were present and the fish was not in mass atresia. Thus abortive maturation fish may have been included in results, and would have been assumed to be adult skip spawning. This would impact the asymptote. For this assessment samples were re-read to provide a more accurate maturity determination that identifies the differences between biologically mature and functionally mature fish as well as to minimize any mis-classified post spawning/recovering fish as skip spawners because of the timing of collection for some samples. While many maturity determinations didnâ€™t change, there were greater uncertainties about whether a fish was post spawning/recovering or post skip spawning. It is possible that errors in previous maturity determinations made it appear that there was a higher rate of skip spawning that was actually occurring. Using the updated analysis, there was more variability length at maturity when the asymptote approaches 1, which appears to look like skip spawning, and that variability was reduced when age at maturity was used because ages can represent a wide range of lengths.  -->

#### Fecundity

Fecundity was fixed at the parameter values from the meta-analysis in
[@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. Existing species specific fecundity
information for canary rockfish is limited and only 9 samples of canary
rockfish exist within the rockfish fecundity database housed at the
\gls{sefsc} (S. Beyer, personal communication, May 22, 2023, University
of Washington). [@dick_meta-analysis_2017] performed their analysis on
subgenera with at least three species, which excluded canary rockfish,
so the relationship in [@dick_meta-analysis_2017] for general *Sebastes*
species was used for this assessment. Fecundity was assumed as a power
function of length, as in [@dick_meta-analysis_2017], whereas the
previous assessment assumed fecundity was linearly proportional to
weight and used parameter estimates from [@dick_modeling_2009]. Although
these reflect different parameterizations, they are transferrable based
on the weight-length relationship. The fecundity relationship for this
assessment was
`r paste0('$', format(model$FecPar1, scientific = TRUE), 'L^{', round(model$FecPar2,2), '}$')`
in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. The new relationship
results in a decrease in fecundity at larger sizes compared to the
relationship used in the 2015 assessment (Figure
\ref{fig:compare_fecundity}).

### Steepness

Steepness is defined as the proportion of average recruitment for an
unfished population that is expected for a population with 20% of
unfished spawning output. It represents a measure of compensation in the
spawner-recruit relationship. It is typically difficult to estimate
using data for a single population (Conn et al., 2010), which has led to
a series of meta-analyses to estimate its likely value (Dorn, 2002;
Myers et al., 1995).

Steepness in this assessment was fixed at the prior mean value. The
SSC-approved prior for steepness in 2023 assumes a beta distribution
with a mean of 0.72 and standard deviation of 0.16
[@pfmc_accepted_2023]. The prior parameters are based on the
Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish
assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC,
NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical
Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently
rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted
in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method
for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the
previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

### Length-Weight Relationship

```{r include=FALSE}
library(here)
w.l <- read.csv(here('data/W_L_pars.csv'))
```

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the
model using available coastwide biological data collected from the
\gls{s-wcgbt}. This included `r w.l$n[w.l$Sex=='F']` females and
`r w.l$n[w.l$Sex=='M']` males. The estimated length-weight relationship
for `r spp` was
`r paste0('$W =', format(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen1[1], scientific = TRUE), 'L^{', round(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen2[1],2), '}$')`
for females and
`r paste0('$W =', format(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen1[2], scientific = TRUE), 'L^{', round(model$Growth_Parameters$WtLen2[2],2), '}$')`
for males, where $L$ is fork length in cm and $W$ is weight in kg
(Figure \ref{fig:WL}). The curve was fit as a linear model in log space
and then corrected for lognormal bias. The relationship is similar to
the relationship used in the previous 2015 benchmark assessment and
indicates that male and female `r spp` have similar length-weight
relationships (Figure \ref{fig:compare_WL}).

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

`r Spp` display sexually dimorphic growth. Females grow slower and
obtain larger sizes than males. Recent research also indicates that
`r spp` growth varies latitudinally [@keller2018canary;
@Brooks_thesis_2021]. Using \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-hkl} data and
considering breakpoints at the biogeographic boundaries of Point
Conception and Cape Mendocino, Keller et al. [-@keller2018canary] found
growth differences that were statistically significant but inconsistent
across sexes. However, the bulk of the `r spp` population, and
particularly the bulk of older individuals needed to reliably estimate a
growth curve, are found north of Cape Mendocino. More consistent with
theory, Brooks [-@Brooks_thesis_2021] found that individuals of both
sexes tended to grow slower and to larger sizes farther north, with a
break point estimated between Coos Bay, OR and Newport, OR based on data
from samples collected in untrawlable habitat, with similar numbers
coming from each major port along the coast. We explored estimating two
growth curves external to the assessment model split at Coos Bay, OR,
but using the more expansive \gls{s-wcgbt} data (1567 vs.
`r sum(wcgbts.summary[,'N ages'])` samples; maximum age of 51 vs. 65).
Results indicated that although individuals captured north of Coos Bay
did grow to slightly larger sizes than those captured south of Coos Bay,
particularly female individuals, the differences were biologically minor
and did not warrant the additional complexity in the stock assessment
model (Figure \ref{fig:spatial_AL}). Thus, growth was assumed constant
across the coast, as was assumed in the 2015 benchmark assessment.
**TODO: These values are wrong, Brian I am not sure where the right
values are** Externally estimated von-Bertalanffy growth parameters for
`r spp` using \gls{s-wcgbt} data were as follows: $L_\infty$ =
`r model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1]` and $k$ =
`r model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1[1]` for females with length at age
1 equal to `r model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amin_Fem_GP_1[1]`, and $L_\infty$ =
`r model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1[1]` and $k$ =
`r model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1[1]` for males with length at age 1
set equal to the length at age 1 for females. We therefore assume size
of young males and females are identical, consistent with the
assumptions in the 2015 bechmark assessment. These estimates were used
as initial values within the base model for estimating growth.

### Sex Ratio

As described in the mortality section, the observed sex ratio is skewed
towards males at older ages (Figure \ref{fig:sex_ratio_age}). Sex ratio
based on length is skewed towards females at larger sizes due to the
sexually dimorphic growth (Figure \ref{fig:sex_ratio_length}). A cursory
look at sex ratios within the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} by latitude
indicate that males and females are similarly dispersed coastwide, and
that differences in sex ratios at age are not due to latitudinal or
depth specific differences (Figure
\@ref(fig:biology-sexratio-lengthbylatitude)), and thus, a sex ratio of
50:50 was assumed for this assessment, as was done in the 2015 benchmark
assessment. **TODO: Figure**

### Ageing Precision and Bias

The ageing error matrices used in the 2015 benchmark assessment for
break and burn samples were retained for this analysis. Ageing error was
explored in the 2015 assessment including extensive model selection and
exploration on the ageing methods to includes and the appropriate aging
lab to treat as unbiased [@thorson_status_2015]. An extensive
description on the history of including ageing error and bias into past
canary assessments was also provided in the 2015 asessment
[@thorson_status_2015]. Surface read ages were not included in this
assessment and therefore surface read ageing error matrices from the
2015 assessment were not retained in the model.

Per the 2015 assessment, ages from the CAPS ageing laboratory were
assumed unbiased, and a linear bias for break-and-burn reads from ODFW
and WDFW ageing labs were estimated alongwith a constant coefficient of
variation (CV) for imprecision for break-and-burn reads from CAPS, ODFW,
and WDFW. The estimated pattern for bias and imprecision (*Add figure
here. Jim's figure 37*) indicates that ODFW break-and-burn reads are
almost unbiased relative to CAPS break-and-burn reads, and the WDFW
break-and-burn reads have a positive bias relative to CAPS
break-and-burn reads (+3.76 yrs. at age 30).

A qualitative examination of the new break and burn double reads showed
no evidence that the ageing estimation had changed over time relative to
the samples included in the previous analyses. Furthermore, a new
TMB-based ageing error software has been developed (A. Punt pers. comm.)
but has not yet been fully explored or documented. Therefore, revision
of the ageing error matrices has been left as a research project to be
completed in time for the next full assessment.

*We need to do this qualitative analysis. TO DO: KIVA* *Add figure of
ageing error* *We need to add in the bomb radiocarbon bias to these*

*Do we want to keep in sample size information? Im commenting this out
in part because we dont update so new data numbers are irrelevant*
<!-- In this assessment, we obtain all available double read data and re-estimate bias and imprecision for reads provided by ODFW, WDFW, and CAPS labs using either break-and-burn or surface read techniques.  This includes 2,307 unique otoliths with double-reads primarily among readers at the CAPS laboratory, obtained from P. McDonald (personal communication, Nov. 20, 2014), as well as 6,544 unique otoliths with double-reads between CAPS or ODFW laboratories and the WDFW laboratory, obtained from P. Weyland (personal communication, Dec. 17, 2014).  Exploratory analysis indicated memory problems with the analysis software unless reads were restricted to those aged 60 or younger, and this restriction decreased the total sample size to 8,812 (from 8,851).  All reads were classified by laboratory and reader method, resulting in five unique categories for ageing error:  CAPS break-and-burn (4,991 unique reads); ODFW break-and-burn (2,400 unique reads); WDFW break-and-burn (10,180 unique reads); ODFW surface reads (199 unique reads); and WDFW surface reads (576 unique reads), where the total number of unique reads for each lab exceeds the number of unique otoliths because otoliths are read twice or three times each. -->
