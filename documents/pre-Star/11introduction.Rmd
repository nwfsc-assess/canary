# Introduction
## Basic Information
Canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger) are distributed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the western Gulf of Alaska to northern Baja California; however, the species is most abundant from British Columbia to central California [Miller and Lea 1972, Hart 1973, @love2002rockfishes]. A map showing the California Current, as well as the major landmarks and dividing lines between the five \gls{inpfc} areas is shown in Figure REF.  Adults are primarily found along the continental shelf shallower than 300 m, although they are occasionally observed in deeper waters. Juvenile canary rockfish are found in shallow and intertidal areas [@love2002rockfishes].

As in past assessments, this assessment treats the U.S. canary rockfish resource from the Mexican border to the Canadian border as a single coast-wide stock.  However, unlike past assessments, the model explicitly tracks differences in age-structure and stock status in each of three spatial strata, divided by the 42°N and 46°N parallels, and informally referred to as CA (32-42°N), OR (42-46°N), and WA (46-49°N).  The model tracks spatial differences in demographics because previous research indicates that spatial differences in exploitation rates or history can result in time-varying selectivity when analyzed using a nonspatial model [@sampson2011spatial], and because the common “areas-as-fleets” approach is not likely to account for differences in exploitation history in many cases [@cope2011reconciling].  


## Life History
Canary rockfish are a medium to large-bodied rockfish; achieving a maximum size of around 70 cm. Female canary rockfish reach slightly larger sizes than males.  Canary rockfish are relatively long-lived, with a maximum observed age of 84 years.  However, in both the California Current and the coastal waters off British Columbia, only males are commonly observed above the age of 50, while females tend to be rare above age 30. The degree to which this pattern reflects behavioral differences translating to reduced availability to fishery and survey fishing gear, or an increase in relative mortality for older females has been the focus of much discussion and remains unclear. A similar pattern has been observed for yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus), a closely related but more pelagic species with a similar distribution [@wallace2005yellowtail].  Since the 2002 assessment, this pattern has been accommodated within the stock assessment model by allowing female natural mortality to increase at approximately the age of first sexual maturity.  Benchmark and update assessments starting in 2002 have included an increased rate of female natural mortality post-maturity, as justified by an increase in behavioral risk or physiological stress resulting from female spawning.

Adult canary rockfish primarily inhabit areas in and around rocky habitat. They form very dense schools, leading to an extremely patchy population distribution that is reflected in both fishery and survey encounter rates. This distribution strongly affects the calculation and interpretation of population indices and age- or size-composition data.  In particular, a patchy spatial distribution, combined with a low rate of encounter, results in an estimated index of abundance that has large estimation intervals and is relatively uninformative about trends in population abundance.  Juvenile canary rockfish are found in shallow and intertidal areas [@love2002rockfishes]. Canary rockfish spawn in the winter, producing pelagic larvae and juveniles that remain in the upper water column for 3-4 months [@love2002rockfishes]. These juveniles settle in shallow water around nearshore rocky reefs, where they may congregate for up to three years (Boehlert, 1980; Sampson, 1996) before moving into deeper water. The mean size of individuals captured in the trawl survey shows a characteristic ontogenetic shift to deeper water with increasing body size. The degree to which this ontogenetic shift may be accompanied by a component of latitudinal dispersal from shallow rocky reefs is unknown.

There exists little direct information regarding the stock structure of canary rockfish off the U.S. Pacific coast. Limited tagging research conducted off Oregon found that of 10 canary rockfish recovered, 4 moved over 25 km, and 3 moved more than 100 km over a period of several years [@demott1982movement]. A single canary from that study moved 326 km to the south, and those that moved the farthest also moved to much greater depths than the shallow reefs at which they had been tagged. Early genetic research found patterns suggestive of some population structuring between the northern California/southern Oregon and northern Oregon/southern Washington, but this work was based on limited sampling and also found evidence of reduced gene flow between shallow and deeper areas [@wishard1980stock]. There is ongoing research on the population genetics of canary rockfish, which may be more tractable with modern methods [@gomez2003microsatellite], and recent research indicates little support for population structure within the California Current [@budrick2016evolutionary].

There are few biogeographic boundaries clearly applicable to rockfish on the U.S. and Canadian west coasts.  However, canary rockfish are not found in large numbers south of Point Conception. The divergence zone at the northern edge of Vancouver Island likely creates a barrier for pelagic dispersal and productivity for many species [@ware1989fisheries]; therefore it is the southern portion of the B.C. canary resource that is most likely to have dynamics linked to the U.S. resource. It is likely that canary rockfish cross the U.S. Canadian border as pelagic larvae, juveniles, and possibly adults making their ontogenetic shift to deeper water or moving between areas of rocky habitat. 

The 2002 assessment integrated what had previously been separate north-south assessments based on the observations of highest density occurring near headlands and \gls{inpfc} boundaries commonly used to delineate management and assessment areas [@methot2002canary]. They reasoned that splitting stocks or assessments at any \gls{inpfc} boundaries would divide high-density areas that most likely are biologically linked. This logic was followed in the 2005 benchmark assessment and subsequent 2007 and 2009 update assessments, separating fishing fleets geographically to account for potential spatial patterns while retaining a coast-wide assessment area. All U.S. assessments have used the U.S.-Canadian border as the northern boundary for the stock, although the basis for this choice appears to be largely based on both (1) consistency with current management needs, and (2) data availability and feasibility of expanding data from multiple jurisdictions within a single stock assessment.


## Ecosystem Considerations
Canary rockfish are reported to have a diverse diet. Pelagic juveniles consume copepods, amphipods and krill while adults consume krill and many species of small fish [@love2002rockfishes]. The degree to which variability in food supply may affect body condition, spawning success or annual growth is unknown. Canary rockfish are a medium to large-bodied rockfish that achieve a maximum size of around 70 cm. Female canary rockfish reach slightly larger sizes than males.

Although ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, there are several important aspects of the recent California current ecosystem that appear to warrant consideration.  Lingcod, a potentially important predator of small canary, have rebuilt over the last two decades [@johnson2021lingcod_s; @taylor2021lingcod_n]. To the extent that the component of natural mortality of canary rockfish added by predation from lingcod and other predators has been increasing over recent years, recruitment may be underestimated. This effect could also lead to longer than predicted rebuilding times for canary rockfish. The effects of the \gls{pdo} on California current temperature and productivity [@mantua_pacific_1997] may also contribute to non-stationary dynamics for canary rockfish. The prevalence of a strong 1999 year-class for many west coast groundfish species suggest that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life-history strategies [@stachura2014linking; @thorson2013using].  Much research is currently underway to explore these phenomena, and it appears likely that more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes and influences may be possible in future canary rockfish stock assessments.


## Historical and Current Fishery Information
The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast developed first off California late in the 19th century and was catching an average of almost 2,500 metric tons per year over the period 1916-1940 (with an increase in catches in 1916, during World War I). To the north, the rockfish fishery developed slowly and became established during the early 1940s, when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortages of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein [@alverson1964study; @harry_history_1961]. Rockfish catches dropped somewhat following the war, and were generally stable from the 1950s to the 1960s. 

Historically, the vast majority of canary rockfish off the U.S. Pacific coast have been harvested by commercial trawling vessels, followed by hook-and-line (primarily vertical longline), shrimp trawls, and various miscellaneous gears (e.g., nets and pots). In 1977, when the \gls{msfcma} was enacted, the large foreign-dominated rockfish fishery that had developed since the late 1960s had its catches eliminated, and the domestic trawl fishery subsequently increased its catches. Canary rockfish were also sought by recreational anglers and considered to be a moderately important species caught in the private vessel and charter boat fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and northern California.

Inspection of the historical catch reconstruction for canary rockfish (REFERENCE) shows that reconstructed catches from 1892 to 2014 (FIGURE) were highest historically in the trawl and foreign fisheries.  The trawl fishery was high during the end of WWII (1945: 4,034 mt), but decreased during the 1950s-1960s.  A foreign fleet operated 1966-1976, and nearly exceeded the domestic trawl landings in 1966 (TWL: 1,647, FOR: 1,599 mt), and was replaced by the domestic bottom trawl fleet following the \gls{msfcma} (1978: 3,853 mt).  The trawl fishery reached a peak in the early 1980s (1982: 5,029 mt) and subsequently decreased after the establishment of strict management restrictions starting in the mid-1990s.  The decrease in the trawl fishery has allowed the recreational and non-trawl fisheries to take a larger proportion of total catch in the 2000s, and catches during bottom trawl survey operations have also been a nontrivial portion of total fishing mortality in the past decade.  Catches also varied considerably among spatial strata, with the OR stratum having highest catches during the 1950-1960s, and again during the 1980s.  Differences in exploitation history are considerable among areas, and support the use of a spatially stratified assessment model. 


## Summary of Management History and Performance
The first regulations established on the canary rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast were implemented in 1983 as trip limits (40,000 lb. per trip) on the entire Sebastes complex (a market category that at the time included all rockfish species except Pacific Ocean perch and widow) harvested from the U.S. Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas [@pfmc2002status]. Commercial vessels were not required to separate most rockfish catches into individual species, but rather, only into mixed-species categories, such as the Sebastes complex. Port biologists in each state routinely sample market categories (e.g., Sebastes complex) to determine the actual species composition of these mixed-species categories. Since 1967, various port sampling programs have been utilized by state and federal marine fishery agencies to determine the species compositions of the commercial groundfish landings off the U.S. Pacific coast (Sampson and Crone, 1997). Stratified, multistage sampling designs are currently used in the port sampling programs for purposes of evaluating the species compositions of the total landings, as well as for obtaining biological data on individual species [@crone_sampling_1995; @sampson1997commercial].

From 1983 through 1994, canary rockfish were monitored as part of the Sebastes complex, with various trip limits imposed over this 10-yr span. In 1993 and 1994, commercial fishermen communicated that fewer canary rockfish were being caught in their rockfish tows [@pfmc2002status]. The 1994 canary rockfish stock assessment (Sampson and Stewart, 1994) confirmed that the observed declines in the field were likely the result of a population that had not responded favorably to recent levels of fishing pressure and further recommended that the canary rockfish \gls{abc} be reduced to allow the stock to recover. Beginning in 1995, the \gls{abc} for canary rockfish was reduced nearly 60%, to 1,250 mt. In 1995, trip limits specific to canary rockfish (cumulative monthly trip limit of 6,000 lb.) were imposed and commercial vessels were required to sort canary rockfish from other rockfishes. In 1998, catches of canary rockfish were regulated using a two-month cumulative trip limit of 40,000 lb. for the Sebastes complex, of which, no more than 15,000 lb. (38%) could be composed of canary rockfish, i.e., although this species was allocated its own market category, it was still being managed as part of the mixed-species complex. The \gls{abc} was further reduced to 1,045 mt.

The two stock assessments conducted in 1999 (California and Washington-Oregon) found the stock to be depleted and an overfished determination was made in 2000. Subsequently, commercial and recreational fishing opportunities were severely restricted and recent removals have been from bycatch. Canary rockfish have become a limiting species for fisheries that target other commercially important species on the continental shelf. The OY in 2003 was 44 mt; which was only about 1% of the peak annual catches in the early 1980s. Management regulations were sufficiently strict to keep the catch that year to only 51 mt. Canary rockfish remains one of the most intensively followed species by regulatory agencies, NGO’s and industry. Table 1 summarizes the coast-wide ABC’s and catch in recent years.

Beginning in 2000, shelf rockfish species (including canary) could no longer be retained by vessels using bottom trawl footropes with a diameter of greater than 8 inches. The use of small-footrope gear increases the risk of gear loss in rocky areas, and this restriction was intended to discourage trawlers from fishing in high-relief, rocky habitat.  The impact of the change in gear regulations was reinforced through reductions in landing limits for all other shelf rockfish species.

During 2002 the trawl and non-trawl “Rockfish Conservation Area” (RCA) were implemented to reduce bycatch of overfished rockfish species such as canary in the northern portion of the coast and Boccaccio rockfish in the south. The RCA has since been used as a management tool in each year. Specific boundaries for the trawl RCA have varied across bimonthly periods within and among years in response to changing discard rates and fishery dynamics. In 2003, the shoreward boundary of the RCA ranged from the shoreline to 100 fm. (183 m), and the seaward boundary from 200 to 250 fm. (366-457 m). Small-footrope gear was required shoreward of the RCA when these areas were open, and retention of canary rockfish was limited to 100 to 300 lbs. per month for the limited entry trawl fisheries north and south of 40º10’. Retention of canary rockfish was prohibited in the limited entry fixed gear fishery. In 2004, the shoreward boundary of the RCA ranged from the shoreline to 75 fm. and the seaward boundary from 150 to 250 fm. (274-457 m). This dynamic pattern of the closed area extending from the shoreline (or 75 fm.) out to 150 fm. (274 m), 200 fm. (366 m) or 250 fm. (457 m) has continued through 2015. Deeper depths are generally closed in the winter months and there are a number of latitudinal differences in the extent of the current RCA, however the large majority of depths deeper than 75 fm. (137 m) where canary rockfish occur are now closed to all commercial on-bottom fishing for groundfish. It is possible that by closing most of the depth range of the species the RCA has influenced the size range of canary rockfish available to the fishery. Smaller canary rockfish are available to the commercial fishery when the shoreward boundary is set at 137 m, while some of the larger fish may occur in the closed area.  Juvenile canary rockfish are also available to the nearshore commercial and recreational fisheries. 

Bimonthly trip limits have remained very small in recent years. Beginning in 2005, the modified “flatfish” trawl gear has been required shoreward of the RCA. This gear was found to reduce the catch-per-unit-effort of canary rockfish relative to standard commercial gear in pilot experiments (King et al., 2004). 
Recreational limits have also been substantially reduced for more than a decade. After first reducing bag limits, since 2003 all three states have allowed no retention of canary rockfish during recreational fishing. Mortality associated with this fishery is now comprised of discard mortality from fish that are caught while targeting other species such as Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) or other rockfish.

Beginning in 2000, when the stock was first managed as an overfished species management harvest guidelines were dramatically curtailed.  Since that time, the fishery has been far below ABC levels (< 300 mt). 

A groundfish trawl rationalization program was commenced in 2010 via Amendment 20 to the Groundfish Fisheries Management Plan. Under this program, groundfish limited entry trawl vessels making shoreside deliveries are managed primarily through a system of individual fishing quotas (hereafter referred to as ITQs).  Trawl permit holders were provided with quota share percentages of the allowable catch of major species and assemblages, based on historical fishery participation.  After Annual Catch Limits are set for species for a given year, the shares are used to calculate individual quotas (in weight) that represent the amount of species’ catch the permitted individual (and associated vessel) are entitled to catch.  Unlike previous management, which relied on limiting the landings of vessels, the new system holds individual vessels responsible for retained and discarded catch.  Discard amounts are verified by 100% at-sea observation of participating vessels.  Vessel accountability for discards has generally led to a reduction in fleet discards since implementation for Pacific rockfishes as a whole.  A system for tracking quota balances was also created, and vessels are not allowed to fish when they have negative balances for any species/assemblage.  Quota pounds have been transferable between permit holders since the program’s beginning, and now the shares of most species may be sold.  Accumulation of shares or pounds is subject to accumulation and usage caps.  Additionally, the program provided the opportunity for trawl pounds to be fished with other gears on qualified vessels (“gear switching”).

Catch accountability for motherships and associated catcher-vessels in the mothership sector for Pacific hake was achieved through a system of regulated cooperatives.  Pacific hake catcher-processors operated for years as a voluntary cooperative, and that arrangement was formalized by provisions of Amendment 20.  Cooperatives in both of these sectors receive annual poundage allocations of hake and non-hake species, based on the entitlements of cooperative members, and these amounts are not transferable between cooperatives.  There is also no provision for voluntary transfers of pounds or shares between fishery sectors.


## Foreign Fisheries
Canary rockfish in Canadian waters appear to have similar life-history characteristics (Stanley et al., 2005). Longevity appears consistent with the U.S. coast, with a maximum observed age of 84 years. The rapid disappearance of females older than age 20-25 is clearly observed in the Canadian samples summarized in 2005 (Stanley et al., 2005, p. 11).  The canary rockfish resource in Canadian waters is estimated to be stable in each of three areas: the coast of Vancouver Island, central Queen Charlotte Sound and the north coast (Stanley et al., 2005). Removals by the trawl fishery have been relatively stable since 1996 at just under 500 mt for the Vancouver Island area, but were around twice that level over the preceding decade.

It is difficult to conclude what the current status of canary rockfish is off Alaska. In the federal waters off the Gulf of Alaska, canary rockfish are assessed and managed as a minor part of an assemblage including seven species of demersal shelf rockfishes (Green et al., 2014). The primary component of this ‘non-commercial’ group is yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), although quillback (Sebastes maliger), copper (Sebastes caurinus), China (Sebastes nebulosus), tiger (Sebastes nigrocinctus) and rosethorn (Sebastes helvomaculatus) are also included. The primary biomass estimate of yelloweye rockfish is based on submersible observations.  No direct indices of canary abundance in the Gulf of Alaska have been reported.
