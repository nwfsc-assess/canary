### Parameter Estimates

*Ensure WL1 for male and female and eggs scalar are sceientific method*
*Set priors of unestimated values to -99 uniformly*
*Remove the triennial late line as its mirrored*

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors (SD column) are shown in Table \@ref{tab:params}. This table enumerates a total of 241 estimated parameters. These include one parameter for $R_0$, one parameter for female natural mortality, 10 parameters describing growth, one parameter for survey catchability in the \gls{s-tri}, one parameter for extra variability for the pre-recruit survey, 71 parameters for length-based selectivity and block along with 25 parameters for sex-dependent selectivity, and 131 recruitment deviations.

#### Biology parameters

The estimates of growth parameters by sex varied relative to the externally estimated starting values (Table \ref{tab:params}).  The length-at-age 1 for both sexes were less than the external estimates using the survey age data while the $L_\infty$ estimates for both sexes were higher than the external estimates. The estimated $k$ for females and males was greater than the values estimated externally, with the value for females being more similar. Although estimated growth differed from external estimates, external estimates were within the 95 percent confidence interval (with males near the lower edge) given the estimated uncertainty from the model (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). The coefficition of variation in in growth was assumed to be function of length at age. Although estimates for the coefficient of variation at $L_\infty$ were approximately half those at length-at-age 1 for males and females, which given the estimates for length at older and younger fish, results in greater variability in length at larger sizes. 

####	Selectivity
Length-based selectivity curves were estimated using a double-normal pattern for every fishery and survey, and time-block, except where selectivity was mirrored among fleets. A double-normal selectivity pattern allows flexibility in the model to estimate either asymptotic or dome-shaped selectivity. Estimated selectivity curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:comm-selex-female}--\ref{fig:noncomm-selex-female} for females and Figures \ref{fig:comm-selex-male}--\ref{fig:noncomm-selex-male} for males, with selectivity parameters provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. Nearly all fleets show a strong dome-shaped pattern with the execption of the Oregon and Washington trawl fleet from 2000--2011, the Oregon non-trawl fleet prior to 2000, and the \gls{s-tri}. The amount of unavailable biomass for `r spp` is large in the early time period, declines during the period of peak exploitation, and then increases since 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:unavail-bio}). 
**Add statement about sensitvity to having a full asymptotic fleet to teh above**

For the trawl fleets, the length at peak selectivity is greatest prior to 2000, with the California peak at 46 cm and the mirrored Oregon and Washington peak at 49 cm. Selectivity shifts towards smaller fish in recent time periods between 3--6 cm depending on the fleet and time block. The pattern of dome-ness between time periods is stronger in California in recent years whereas for Oregon and Washington the curve tends to shift towards smaller fish, and to an asymptotic pattern between 2000-2011. The foreign fleets are mirrored to the trawl fleets and have the same selectivity curves. 

For the non-trawl fleets, the patterns in selectivity are more variable, reflecting the sparseness of the compositional data. In California, selectivity for smaller fish than in the trawl fleet, with a peak at 36 cm. The range of lengths selected is more compressed but has shifted towards larger fish by 2 cm in the most recent years compared to before 2000. The selectivity curve has changed the most over time in Oregon. Prior to 2000, the peak in selectivity was 55 cm, lowered to 33 cm in the 2000s, and increased to 45 cm in the most recent period. The Washington non-trawl fleet has sparse data so has constant selectivity across time, and has a peak at 47 cm.  

The at-sea-hake fishery has mirrored selectivity across each state given the similarities in the fishery along the coast. The selectivity is more narrow than either the trawl or non-trawl fleets, with a steep increase around 40 cm and peak at 44 cm. No time-varying selectivity is applied to the at-sea-hake fishery.

For the recreational fishery, the length at peak selectivity is shifted towards smaller fish compared to the commercial fleets. Selectivity increases sharply and reaches a peak of 29 cm in California, 30 cm in Oregon and 34 cm in Washington. For all fleets, selectivity in the earlier time periods is shifted towards smaller fish. Selectivity for Washington shifts greatly in 2021-2022 to a peak of 48 cm, which may be due in part to being the last two years whereas the recent block for other fleets includes earlier years. All recreational fleets show strong dome-ness, with the greatest decline during the period of non-rentention. 

Among surveys, the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} are estimated to have a slowly increasing selectivity curve across  a wide range of lengths; starting at very small sized and increasing to a peak near 43--44cm. This likely reflects the spatial and bathymetric coverage and non-targeting nature of the survey design compared to the fishery. Selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} declines for larger individuals whereas for the \gls{s-tri} selectivity is nearly asymptotic. No time-varying selectivity is applied for the surveys, and the \gls{s-tri} is mirrored across the early and late period.

For all fleets and surveys, male selectivity shows a greater dome-ness than females. This is likely compensating for a lower availability of large females given that their natural mortality estimate is larger than males, as opposed to females being more unavailability to the fishery. Thus, greater selectivity for females allows them to be selectied for at a larger size prorportional to their occurrence in the population, which is less than males due to greater mortality.

**Need o move elsewhere to where we describe model structure. Seems redundant here**
We specifically estimated three parameters for each selectivity curve, including
	1. the minimum length at which selectivity is one (the “peak”), 
	2. the width of the ascending curve for selectivity at lengths less than the peak, 
	3. the width of the descending curve for selectivity at lengths greater than the peak plus the width of the dome.
We additionally estimate a change in selectivity for the trawl and non-trawl fisheries between 1999 and 2000 (reflecting changes in fisher behavior following the declaration of overfished status for canary rockfish in 1999), and another change in selectivity for the trawl fishery between 2010 and 2011 (reflecting a change in fisher behavior following the implementation of individual transferable quotas starting in 2011).  For each break-point change in selectivity, we re-estimate all four parameters.  Hence, there is no information regarding selectivity that is shared among time blocks.

#### Catchability

Catchability for surveys comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years was either analytically solved for the \gls{s-wcgbt} or estimated for the \gls{s-tri}. The \gls{s-tri} was mirrored across the early and late period so catchability was the same. The values for catchability are commensurate with surveys for a species that is partially inaccessible and caught on a subset of tows (Table **add table where percent positive tows goes**). Catchability in regular space was 0.51 for the \gls{s-wcgbt} analytical value and estimated to be 0.24 for the mirrored \gls{s-tri} (Table \ref{tab:params}). Additional fishery and survey index variability, which is process error added directly to each year's input standard deviation for the pre-recruit survey was estimated within the model at 0.464. Fits to other surveys were near enough to confidence intervals of the estimates of the survey such that additional varaibility was not added.

#### Stock-recruit parameters

In this assessment the logarithm of $R_0$ was estimated, while steepness was fixed at its prior mean of 0.72. Lognormal deviations from the standard Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship were estimated from 1892-2022 with a fixed $\sigma_R$ value of 0.5. There is limited information regarding recruitment prior to 1960 but deviations are estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty around the unfished condition to a degree consistent with estimated variability in recruitment. The time series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. The spawner-recruit curve is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}.

Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in the 1960s and continued through 2000. Starting around 2004 recruitment deviations became more consistently negative and were their most negative in 2018. This period corresponds to a period of relatively sparse compositional data. Deviations have increased to average levels since 2018 but these deviations are more uncertain given the few years available to sample these age classes. The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adjust}. This relationship was updated during early model exploration with the final version near to the suggested alternative provided within r4ss such that it was left at the earlier values.

### Population Trajectory

Summary time series of population trajectories are provided in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. The estimated spawning output (in billions of eggs) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}, total biomass in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}, spawning output relative to unfished in Figure \ref{fig:depl}, and fishing intensity measured as one minus the spawning potential ratio (1-SPR) in Figure \ref{fig:spr}. Spawning output declines from the 1940s with the increase in harvest (Figure \ref{fig:catches}), stabilizes in the 1970s, and then declines to its lowest point in 1995. Spawning output stabilizes until 2000 when levels increase steadily to recent years with a slowing trend. The estimated total biomass follows the same general trend as observed in spawning output but with a more pronounced decrease from 1980 to 1995 (Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}). The estimated spawning output relative to the unfished equilibrium spawning output was at its lowest (`r round(100*min(model$sprseries$Deplete,na.rm=TRUE), 1)` percent) in 1995 and has since increase to within the precautionary zone at `r round(100*model$current_depletion, 1)` percent in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Population trajectories track the patterns in fishing intensity, where fishing intensity was steadily above that which would produce an SPR of 0.5 starting in the 1960s (Figure \ref{fig:spr}). Fishing intensity has been low since 2000 but has increased to levels near that corresponding to an SPR of 0.5.
