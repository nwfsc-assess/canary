## Base Model Results

**Brian is working on this section - just need to do fits to data**

### Parameter Estimates

**For the params tables**

*Ensure WL1 for male and female and eggs scalar are scientific method
format*

*Set priors of unestimated values to -99 uniformly*

*Remove the triennial late line as its mirrored*

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic
standard errors (SD column) are shown in Table \@ref{tab:params}. This
table enumerates a total of 241 estimated parameters. These include one
parameter for $R_0$, one parameter for female natural mortality, nine
parameters describing growth, one parameter for survey catchability in
the \gls{s-tri}, one parameter for extra variability for the pre-recruit
survey, 75 parameters for length-based selectivity and blocks along with
22 parameters for sex-dependent selectivity and blocks, and 131
recruitment deviations.

#### Biology parameters

The estimates of growth parameters by sex varied relative to the
externally estimated starting values (Table \ref{tab:params}). The
length-at-age 1 for both sexes were less than the external estimates
using the survey age data while the $L_\infty$ estimates for both sexes
were higher than the external estimates. The estimated $k$ for females
and males was greater than the values estimated externally, with the
value for females being more similar. Although estimated growth differed
from external estimates, external estimates were within the 95 percent
confidence interval (with males near the lower edge) given the estimated
uncertainty from the model (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). The
coefficition of variation in in growth was assumed to be function of
length at age. Although estimates for the coefficient of variation at
$L_\infty$ were approximately half those at length-at-age 1 for males
and females, which given the estimates for length at older and younger
fish, results in greater variability in length at larger sizes.

#### Selectivity

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated using a double-normal
pattern for every fishery and survey, and time-block, except where
selectivity was mirrored among fleets. A double-normal selectivity
pattern allows flexibility in the model to estimate either asymptotic or
dome-shaped selectivity. Estimated selectivity curves are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:comm-selex-female}--\ref{fig:noncomm-selex-female} for
females and Figures
\ref{fig:comm-selex-male}--\ref{fig:noncomm-selex-male} for males, with
selectivity parameters provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. Nearly all
fleets show a strong dome-shaped pattern with the execption of the
Oregon and Washington trawl fleet from 2000--2011, the Oregon non-trawl
fleet prior to 2000, and the \gls{s-tri}. The amount of unavailable
biomass for `r spp` is large in the early time period, declines during
the period of peak exploitation, and then increases since 2000 (Figure
\ref{fig:unavail-bio}). **Add statement about sensitvity to having a
full asymptotic fleet to teh above depending on results**

For the trawl fleets, the length at peak selectivity is greatest prior
to 2000, with the California peak at 46 cm and the mirrored Oregon and
Washington peak at 49 cm. Selectivity shifts towards smaller fish in
recent time periods between 3--6 cm depending on the fleet and time
block. The pattern of dome-ness between time periods is stronger in
California in recent years whereas for Oregon and Washington the curve
tends to shift towards smaller fish, and to an asymptotic pattern
between 2000-2011. The foreign fleets are mirrored to the trawl fleets
and have the same selectivity curves.

For the non-trawl fleets, the patterns in selectivity are more variable,
reflecting the sparseness of the compositional data. In California,
selectivity for smaller fish than in the trawl fleet, with a peak at 36
cm. The range of lengths selected is more compressed but has shifted
towards larger fish by 2 cm in the most recent years compared to before
2000. The selectivity curve has changed the most over time in Oregon.
Prior to 2000, the peak in selectivity was 55 cm, lowered to 33 cm in
the 2000s, and increased to 45 cm in the most recent period. The
Washington non-trawl fleet has sparse data so has constant selectivity
across time, and has a peak at 47 cm.

The at-sea-hake fishery has mirrored selectivity across each state given
the similarities in the fishery along the coast. The selectivity is more
narrow than either the trawl or non-trawl fleets, with a steep increase
around 40 cm and peak at 44 cm. No time-varying selectivity is applied
to the at-sea-hake fishery.

For the recreational fishery, the length at peak selectivity is shifted
towards smaller fish compared to the commercial fleets. Selectivity
increases sharply and reaches a peak of 29 cm in California, 30 cm in
Oregon and 34 cm in Washington. For all fleets, selectivity in the
earlier time periods is shifted towards smaller fish. Selectivity for
Washington shifts greatly in 2021-2022 to a peak of 48 cm, which may be
due in part to being the last two years whereas the recent block for
other fleets includes earlier years. All recreational fleets show strong
dome-ness, with the greatest decline during the period of
non-rentention.

Among surveys, the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} are estimated to have a
slowly increasing selectivity curve across a wide range of lengths;
starting at very small sized and increasing to a peak near 43--44cm.
This likely reflects the spatial and bathymetric coverage and
non-targeting nature of the survey design compared to the fishery.
Selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} declines for larger individuals
whereas for the \gls{s-tri} selectivity is nearly asymptotic. No
time-varying selectivity is applied for the surveys, and the \gls{s-tri}
is mirrored across the early and late period.

For all fleets and surveys, male selectivity shows a greater dome-ness
than females. This is likely compensating for a lower availability of
large females given that their natural mortality estimate is larger than
males, as opposed to females being more unavailability to the fishery.
Thus, greater selectivity for females allows them to be selectied for at
a larger size prorportional to their occurrence in the population, which
is less than males due to greater mortality.

**Need to move elsewhere to where we describe model structure. Seems
redundant here** We specifically estimated three parameters for each
selectivity curve, including 1. the minimum length at which selectivity
is one (the "peak"), 2. the width of the ascending curve for selectivity
at lengths less than the peak, 3. the width of the descending curve for
selectivity at lengths greater than the peak plus the width of the dome.
We additionally estimate a change in selectivity for the trawl and
non-trawl fisheries between 1999 and 2000 (reflecting changes in fisher
behavior following the declaration of overfished status for canary
rockfish in 1999), and another change in selectivity for the trawl
fishery between 2010 and 2011 (reflecting a change in fisher behavior
following the implementation of individual transferable quotas starting
in 2011). For each break-point change in selectivity, we re-estimate all
four parameters. Hence, there is no information regarding selectivity
that is shared among time blocks.

#### Catchability

Catchability for surveys comparing observed to expected vulnerable
biomass across all years was analytically solved for the \gls{s-wcgbt}
and pre-recruit survey, and estimated for the \gls{s-tri}. The
\gls{s-tri} was mirrored across the early and late period so
catchability was the same. The values for catchability of the adult
surveys are commensurate with surveys for a species that is partially
inaccessible and caught on a subset of tows (Tables \ref{tab:wcgbts},
\ref{tab:triennial}). Catchability in regular space was calculated as
0.51 for the \gls{s-wcgbt}, 0.064 for the pre-recruit survey, and
estimated to be 0.24 for the mirrored \gls{s-tri} (Table
\ref{tab:params}). Additional fishery and survey index variability,
which is process error added directly to each year's input standard
deviation for the pre-recruit survey, was estimated within the model at
0.464. Fits to adult surveys were near enough to confidence intervals of
the estimates of the survey that down-weighting the survey data by
estimating additional variability was not warranted.

#### Stock-recruit parameters

In this assessment the logarithm of $R_0$ was estimated, while steepness
was fixed at its prior mean of 0.72. Lognormal deviations from the
standard Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship were estimated from
1892-2022 with a fixed $\sigma_R$ value of 0.5. There is limited
information regarding recruitment prior to 1960 but deviations are
estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty around the
unfished condition to a degree consistent with estimated variability in
recruitment. The time series of estimated recruitments and annual
recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and
\ref{fig:rec-devs}. The spawner-recruit curve is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:bh-curve}.

Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have
occurred in the 1960s and continued through 2000. Starting around 2004
recruitment deviations became more consistently negative and were their
most negative in 2018. This period corresponds to a period of relatively
sparse compositional data. Deviations have increased to average levels
since 2018 but these deviations are more uncertain given the few years
available to sample these age classes. The recruitment bias adjustment
applied within the model across years is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:bias-adjust}. This relationship was updated during early model
exploration with the final version near to the suggested alternative
provided within r4ss such that it was left at the earlier values.

### Fits to the Data

**Create the appendixes** Fits to the data are shown based on the
Pearson residuals for length and marginal age compositions, annual mean
lengths and ages, and aggregated length and marginal age composition for
the fishery. For the surveys, fits to the data are similar; however,
fits of ages are conditioned on length, and fits to the survey indices
are also provided. For simplicity in writing up the fits to data we do
not further distinguish between marginal versus conditional age
compositions. Annual length and age composition fits for both the
fishery and surveys are shown in the Appendix, Sections
\ref{length-data} and \ref{age-data}.

The aggregated fit to the length composition data by fleet is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}. Fits are generally consistent with
observed data aggregated over all years for males, females, and combined
when sex specific data are unavailable. Fits balance the bimodal
patterns for Oregon and Washington recreational data and Oregon
non-trawl data, and are generally consistent for both Washington and
Oregon trawl data, where selectivity was mirrored. The mode of
proportion at length is generally larger for females than males in trawl
gear, reflecting the dimorphic growth in canary, but are similar for
other gears.

Pearson residual plots by fleet (fishery and survey) as well as mean
lengths by year observed from the composition data are shown in (Figures
\ref{fig:len-pearson1}--\ref{fig:mean-len-fit30}). Yearly mean length is
variable for `r spp`, particularly for non-trawl fleets both in terms of
sample sizes within and across years. However, patterns are still
discernible. Patterns in length data indicate a declining trend in mean
length in the fishery starting in the early years (1980s) when data is
available. The decline is best captured in the fit to the Oregon trawl
lengths, although the fit underestimates the decline in mean length, and
to a lesser extent the fit to California and Washington trawl lengths.
Fits also reveal an increase in mean length in recent years, which is
best captured by fits to the non-trawl and recreational fleets, even in
the presence of time-varying patterns in selectivity. Patterns in mean
length for the at-sea-hake fishery and the surveys are generally
uninformative.

The aggregated fit to the age composition data by fleet is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:age-agg-fit}. Fits are generally consistent with
observed data aggregated over all years for males and females despite
selectivity being based on lengths. Fits are best for the trawl fleets,
and poorer for Oregon and Washington non-trawl data, which are sparse
and variable. Fits to age compositions do not capture the steeper
decline and early long tail in the proportion of older fish in the
recreational fleets. The mode of proportion at age is generally similar
for females and males, in contrast to the patterns in length for
particularly the trawl gear. The aggregated age compositions show that
general patterns of increasing selectivity for young individuals, and
declining proportion at age for old individuals, are generally captured.
Summaries also exhibit a greater proportion of males in the plus-group
(age 35+) than females for the trawl fleets.

**Need to add these figures** Pearson residuals plots by fishery fleet
as well as mean age by year observed from the composition data are show
in (Figures \ref{fig:age-pearson1}--\ref{fig:mean-age-fit12}). The range
of ages is larger than the range of lengths, but patterns are comparable
to those observed from the length composition fits. Patterns in age data
also indicate a declining trend in mean age in the fishery starting in
the early years (1980s) when data is available. The decline is best
captured in the fit to the Oregon trawl ages, although the fit
underestimates the decline in mean age. Fits to California trawl ages
are sparse and to Washington trawl ages are overestimating observed
data, but also indicate a decline in mean age. As with lengths,
recreational mean ages suggest an increase in mean age in recent years.
Patterns in mean length for the non-trawl and at-sea-hake fleets are
generally uninformative.

**Need to add these figures** Pearson residuals of conditional
age-at-length compositions are shown for each survey (Figures
\ref{fig:caal-pearson28}--\ref{fig:caal-pearson30}. These show
variability in length at age over time, suggesting use of
conditional-age-at-lengths data better captures model uncertainty than
external estimates of growth. Positive residuals near the lower range of
the data exist for the early \gls{s-tri} and recent years of the
\gls{s-wcgbt}. These suggest the data indicates older male `r spp` at
length than is being estimated in the model for these years, which is
consistent with our comparison of externally estimated growth parameters
for males being near the lower uncertainty range of parameter values
estimated internal to the model. Despite these patterns, predictive
plots where a well-fitting model has a predicted average and state
deviation of age-at-length that is within the 95% predictive interval
are available within the r4ss documentation available online. Predictive
plots for all surveys generally exhibit this behavior, which provides no
evidence of poor fit to conditional age-at-length data, and suggests
that a model with time-constant growth provides a satisfactory
approximation to the process governing age and length.

Fits to indices of abundance are shown for each survey fleet (Figures
\ref{fig:wcgbts-fit}-- \ref{fig:prerec-fit}). These plots show that fits
to the WCGBTS indices are generally within the 95% confidence interval
bounds with the exception of 2009 and 2019. With 19 years of survey
data, approximately one year is expected to fall outside of the 95%
confidence interval. The residuals appear randomly distributed, with no
particularly long strings of positive or negative values. The survey
index increases slowly, with a minor break point between a "low" state
until 2013 and a "high" state thereafter. The triennial survey captures
the general decline in population abundance during the 1980s and early
1990s and the beginning of rebuilding in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The model is unable to capture the sharp rise and fall at the beginning
of the survey time series, and thus falls outside of the 95% confidence
interval in 1980 and 1984. The pre-recruit survey captures high
estimated recruitment events in 2013, 2016, and 2021, though the model
underestimates recruitment in 2016 relative to the survey. The model
falls outside of the input 95% confidence interval in five years (2002,
2004, 2007, 2009, and 2016), but in no years when including the extra
estimated standard deviation. Without the extra standard deviation, the
model can capture the input confidence interval for 2009, but not the
other four years (FIGURE).

### Population Trajectory

Summary time series of population trajectories are provided in Table
\ref{tab:timeseries}. The estimated spawning output (in millions of
eggs) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}, total biomass in Figure
\ref{fig:tot-bio}, spawning output relative to unfished in Figure
\ref{fig:depl}, and fishing intensity measured as one minus the spawning
potential ratio (1-SPR) in Figure \ref{fig:spr}. Spawning output
declines from the 1940s with the increase in harvest (Figure
\ref{fig:catches}), stabilizes in the 1970s, and then declines to its
lowest point in 1995. Spawning output stabilizes until 2000 when levels
increase steadily to recent years with a slowing trend. The estimated
total biomass follows the same general trend as observed in spawning
output but with a more pronounced decrease from 1980 to 1995 (Figure
\ref{fig:tot-bio}). The estimated spawning output relative to the
unfished equilibrium spawning output was at its lowest
(`r round(100*min(model$sprseries$Deplete,na.rm=TRUE), 1)` percent) in
1995 and has since increase to within the precautionary zone at
`r round(100*model$current_depletion, 1)` percent in 2022 (Figure
\ref{fig:depl}). Population trajectories track the patterns in fishing
intensity, where fishing intensity was steadily above that which would
produce an SPR of 0.5 starting in the 1960s (Figure \ref{fig:spr}).
Fishing intensity has been low since 2000 but has increased to levels
near that corresponding to an SPR of 0.5.
