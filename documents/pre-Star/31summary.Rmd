## History of Modeling Approaches

The first formal assessment of the canary rockfish resource off the U.S. Pacific coast was done in 1984 (Golden and Demory, 1984).The final results from the initial assessment in 1984 were largely based on qualitative examinations of trends in age and size distributions generated from both fishery and survey data. The 1984 research also included exploratory efforts to fit dynamic models to time series data, using tools such as Virtual Population Analysis and Stock Reduction Analysis. However, due largely to highly variable sample data and its lack of availability in all years, results from the modeling were not considered scientifically valid. The 1984 assessment concluded that the canary rockfish resource was generally stable at that time and that the current restrictions were still applicable, i.e., the ABC for canary rockfish was roughly 2,700 mt in the early 1980s.

The canary rockfish assessment conducted in 1990 (Golden and Wood, 1990) was the first evaluation to incorporate separable catch-at-age analysis and in particular, the first to use the Stock Synthesis Model. All subsequent stock assessments have used the Stock Synthesis Model to evaluate the status of the canary rockfish population off the U.S. Pacific coast, although the model has undergone considerable development since the first program was presented in 1988. Data sources included in the 1990 assessment model were commercial landings from the fishery (1967-89), age-distribution data from the fishery (1980-88), commercial trawl effort index from the fishery (logbook data from 1980-87), CPUE index from the survey (1977-89), and size-distribution data from the survey (1977-89). The Columbia INPFC area was the only portion of the canary rockfish resource formally modeled in 1990. The 1990 assessment was the first to propose two broad assumptions (alternative scenarios or states of nature) regarding the absence of old females in the sample information relative to males: (1) the females are subject to a different rate of natural mortality than males (e.g., age-dependent natural mortality for females or possibly, constant, but elevated natural mortality rates for females); or (2) the females are less vulnerable to the fishing and sampling gears (e.g., dome-shaped selectivity for females and asymptotic selectivity for males). Based on a F35% management model, results from the 1990 assessment indicated the ABC for the canary rockfish resource in the Columbia INPFC area should be decreased by roughly 30% from 2,100 mt to 1,500 mt; no changes were recommended for ABCs for the other INPFC areas (800 mt for the U.S. Vancouver INPFC area and 600 mt for the Eureka INPFC area). Through 1989, the fishery had not achieved the ABCs recommended for canary rockfish.

The assessment conducted in 1994 again utilized the age-based version of the Stock Synthesis Model to evaluate the status of the canary rockfish population in the Columbia, INPFC area, as well as the U.S. Vancouver INPFC area (Sampson and Stewart, 1994). The data sources in the previous assessment (1990) were updated with statistics from the 1990s, with the exception of the commercial trawl effort index from the fishery, which was omitted from the set of data sources due to sample and estimation biases associated with logbook data. Results from the 1994 assessment clearly indicated that the current level of F exerted on the canary rockfish population exceeded F20% (the overfishing threshold at that time) and thus, the researchers recommended that the ABC be reduced to allow the stock to recover (Sampson and Stewart 1994). Ultimately, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) adopted an ABC for canary rockfish of 1,250 mt for 1995-96, which was a substantial reduction (nearly 60%) from the previous ABC of 2,900 mt (1991-94).

In 1996, the canary rockfish stock was assessed using similar modeling methods and configurations as were used in the previous assessment conducted in 1994 (Sampson, 1996). Data sources were again updated with newly derived statistics (1995-96) and an age-based version of the Stock Synthesis Model was employed. One difference between the 1994 and 1996 assessments was the manner in which error associated with age-distribution data from the fisheries was accommodated. In the 1996 assessment, a single, percent-agreement error structure was used to describe the variability in the age-related data, whereas in 1994, an error-transition matrix was used to standardize multiple sets of age estimates generated from two age readers. Newly obtained data supported findings from the 1994 analyses and final results further indicated that the canary rockfish stock had suffered fishing in excess of F20%. For both scenarios, annual yields based on F35% were estimated to be roughly 1,200 mt per year for 1997-99.

In 1999, two age-structured stock assessments were adopted. An assessment was completed by Williams et al. (1999) for the southern INPFC areas (Eureka and Monterey). A separate assessment was conducted for the Northern INPFC areas (Columbia and US Vancouver) by Crone et al. (1999). Both assessments concluded that the abundance of canary rockfish was below the overfished threshold. A major source of uncertainty was the role that natural mortality and adult movements played in the relative lack of old females. The northern assessment was performed using an age-based stock synthesis model and relied on age distributions to summarize changes in the age-structure. The Southern assessment was a length-based (although still age-structured) model in an ADMB format. The paucity of otolith-aged fish in the Southern area was the reason why lengths were used in the south to describe changes in the age-structure. That assessment also tried to account for effects of sized-based removals on population growth. The subsequent rebuilding analysis relied upon recruitment information from the northern area where the larger portion of the stock occurs.

The 2002 assessment (Methot and Piner, 2002) unified the previous northern and southern assessments into a coast-wide model. New data that had become available since the previous assessment conducted in 1999 were: Commercial fisheries landing data for 1999-2001; Biological data from the commercial trawl fisheries for 1999-2001, including sex, age, and length information, research survey data from the NMFS shelf trawl survey for 2001, including CPUE and biological data and the CPUE from the California recreational fishery. However, previously assembled fishery size- and age-composition data were not re-compiled. This assessment focused on the exploration of two states of nature that were considered in previous assessments: age-dependent natural mortality for females versus dome-shaped female selectivity. Together with the STAR panel, it was concluded that these need not represent discrete hypotheses and that both scenarios could be modeled simultaneously. The 2002 assessment concluded that the canary stock was still at very low levels, 8% of the estimated unexploited conditions.

### 2005 Benchmark

The 2005 assessment (Methot and Stewart, 2005) converted and updated the 2002 effort using Stock Synthesis 2. The largest changes were:

• Re-configure the spatial separation of fisheries to separate northern and southern California due to the north-south difference in occurrence of larger fish and the varying north-south distribution of fishery sampling. Fishery removals were divided among 10 fleets: 1) Southern California trawl, 2) Northern California trawl, 3) Oregon trawl, 4) Washington trawl, 5) Southern California non-trawl, 6) Northern California non-trawl, 7) Oregon and Washington non-trawl, 8) Southern California recreational, 9) Northern California recreational, 10) Oregon and Washington recreational. Oregon and Washington non-trawl and recreational landings were combined due to the relatively small total removals by those fisheries and their low level of consistent biological sampling. • Recalculate all the fishery catch, size and age composition data. • Introduce the mean size-at-age data from the survey and fishery to provide additional information on growth and to attempt to better differentiate age selectivity from size-selectivity. • Extend the modeled period back to 1916 when first significant catches occurred. • Extend maximum age in the data file to 35+ per request from previous review. • Switch from age-based selectivity to length-based selectivity. That pattern assumed asymptotic selectivity for males and allowed dome-shaped selectivity for females.

Selectivity was the subject of much exploration, ultimately leading to the choice of a length-based parameterization. Information from radiocarbon studies of canary ageing techniques was included to guide the degree of bias likely occurring in production ageing, and the degree of ageing precision was re-estimated from double-read projects. Differential male-female selectivity was allowed for the data sources with suitable data (northern California trawl, Oregon trawl, Washington trawl, shelf trawl survey). Iterative re-weighting was used to adjust all input sample sizes and survey standard error, in some cases resulting in large increases (or decreases) in input sample size relative to the number of trips/hauls actually sampled. Trawl and recreational fishery CPUE were dropped from the model because there had been insufficient work to validate the potential degree of non-linearity in the abundance to CPUE relationship. The parameters defining the variability in size-at-age were fixed at values estimated outside the model from the trawl survey size-age data, rather than allow the model to update these values. At the SSC review of the canary rockfish assessment (Sept. 27-30, 2005; Seattle, WA) it was concluded that the parametric variance around a single base model underestimated the overall uncertainty in the canary rockfish assessment. After considerable deliberation, the SSC and STAT concluded that the Base and Alternate models were equally likely and supported a statistically based blend of the two models as the basis for the rebuilding analysis. The level of relative depletion for the 2005 base case was estimated to be 0.038 when the stock reached its minimum level in 2000, then increasing to 0.057 in 2005. In the alternate 2005 model, the minimum was 0.065 in 1999 and the value in 2005 was estimated to be 0.113.

### 2007 Becnhmark

The 2007 benchmark assessment proceeded by rebuilding all data streams and re-examining all assumptions regarding selectivity, growth, and mortality. The 2007 assessment updated to using a double-normal selectivity option which was simpler than the double-logistic used in the 2005 assessment by 2 parameters (6 vs. 8). By fixing initial selectivity at 0, and the width of the top to a very small quantity (this parameter becomes redundant as the descending width or final selectivity become large) the 2007 assessment was able to re-create the selectivity shapes estimated in the 2005 assessment. However, this change had very little effect on assessment results. The 2007 assessment incorporated substantial new assessment data as well as the addition of the at-sea whiting fleet, research catches, the improved ageing-error definitions and the introduction of conditional age-at-length data for survey fleets. Because of the use of conditional age data in place of marginal age-frequency distributions and mean-length at age data used in 2005, the parameters describing the distribution of length at a given age were also freely estimable. These changes had a larger effect than the selectivity parameterization, serving to increase the estimate of SB0 and current stock size, but had little effect on relative trend over the time series. Changes to the stock-recruit relationship included fixing steepness at 0.35, estimating the full time series of recruitment deviations (1916+ instead of 1952+ in the 2005 assessment) and adding a ramp to bias correction, such that full bias correction for log-normally distributed recruitment was implemented in 1965, declining to no bias correction prior to appreciable signal in the data in 1925 (See SS2 User manual for a thorough discussion of this topic). The 2007 assessment also eliminated several discrete time-blocks for changes in fishery selectivity prior to recent management actions. In aggregate, these changes further scaled the estimate of the time series of spawning biomass up, but retained the relative trend.

The 2007 model was subsequently updated twice, in 2009 (Stewart, 2009) and 2011 (Wallace and Cope, 2011). Following common practice for update assessments, neither made any considerably changes to model structure or assumptions regarding life history parameters. The two main exceptions were: (1) re-running of indices of abundance for the WCGBTS, which required joint estimation using all data starting in 2003, and couldn't be updated sequentially as was done with all other data sources, and (2) updating the catch data to represent best available estimates of historical catches to reflect ongoing efforts at catch reconstruction. The 2009 update substantially decreased catches prior to WWII relative to the 2007 benchmark assessment (Figure 39), while there was relatively little change in catches between 2009 and 2011 updates. Updated data streams in the 2009 assessment resulted in a slightly more pessimistic view of stock status relative to the 2007 benchmark. The downward revision of recent spawning biomass was not attributable to a single data source, but appeared to be incrementally informed by each updated series. Addition of the revised catch history also reduced the scale of the entire time-series estimate of spawning biomass by an average of 14% (19% in the first 10 years of the series and 47% in the last 10). The 2011 update, by contrast, produced little substantial difference in spawning biomass estimates relative to the 2009 update.

### 2015 Benchmark

## Most recent STAR panel and SSC recommendations from 2015 benchmark assessment

**Recommendation:** Catch and discard history for this stock in US waters is highly uncertain. While the STAT was able to construct alternative upper and lower bounds for catch using simple multipliers on certain years of historical catch, this is arbitrary. Work to assess the uncertainty related to each individual data source would allow a better investigation of the overall combined uncertainty and its effect on 10 stock assessments.

**Response:** A more comprehensive Washington reconstruction is almost complete, but was not yet available for use in this assessment. I think we have some new reconstructions we are using from Oregon? Anything else?

**Recommendation:** Improved documentation is required to clearly outline the process used to construct the historical catch and discard time series from the various data sources. Such documentation should also include the process for construction of alternative catch histories that are used to propagate such uncertainty into the stock assessment.

**Response:** This assessment report has attempted to more clearly document the process used to construct the historical catch and discard time series. In addition, the use of github for this assessment (<https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/canary_2023>) means that the code used to construct the time series is publicly available and the process is reproducible. Finally, the STAT has communicated repeatedly with state partners and the GMT to ensure that catch time series are appropriate, per the TOR. This communication did result in changes to the catch history during model development.

**Recommendation:** Additional work on the geospatial index is required to better resolve differences in abundance trends among areas.

**Response:** This assessment did not use a spatially stratified abundance index.

**Recommendation:** Work towards a combined US/Canadian stock assessment would greatly aid our overall understanding of stock status.

**Response:** Little progress has been made on a combined US/Canadian stock assessment. The STAT did obtain catches from a recent British Columbia assessment and **TODO: added these to appropriate Washington fleets as a sensitivity. We might also compare estimates of rec devs?**

**Recommendation:** If data permit, the trawl fleet should be divided into separate components so that bycatches in the shrimp and pelagic trawls are separated from catches in the main bottom trawl fleet. In the current assessment, composition data for the trawl fleet have a major influence on the estimated stock trends, so it would be desirable to use data that are more representative of the main fleet in order to improve estimated selectivity of the fleet.

**Response:** Due to the already extremely complex fleet structure in this model, the shrimp and pelagic trawls were maintained with the main trawl fleet. Analysis indicated **Brian I remember a ? from John F. during the pre-assessment workshop about the appropriateness of including shrimp trawls with the main trawl, and you had a great answer from him, feel free to fill in here.**

**Recommendation:** Basic life history research may help to resolve assessment uncertainties regarding appropriate values for natural mortality and steepness, and how to best account for the apparent loss of older females in the population.

**Response:** This assessment includes fecundity and maturity curves based on new data made available since the last benchmark assessment. While efforts have been undertaken to understand the apparent loss of older females, this has not resulted in any clear resolution. A research study sampling in non-trawlable habitat along the U.S. West Coast found a similar lack of old females in the data [@Brooks_thesis_2021]. Examination of data from the Oregon trawl fleet indicates that sex ratios have been more constant across ages in the last decade than they had been previously (L. Rasmuson, pers. comm.).
