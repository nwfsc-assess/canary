# Data

## Data sources used in this assessment

This assessment uses data from the following sources, which includes all data that was used in the 2011 update assessment and additional data that have not previously been included in any canary assessment. All data sources (including abundance index, length composition, age composition, and catch time series) are split among three spatial strata. We split data sources among strata to allow for examination of strata-specific patterns in model residuals (Punt et al., 2015), and because subsequent comparison demonstrates that spatial partitioning improves fit to the available data. Each data sources is summarized here, and then discussed in more detail below:

1.  Data regarding total removals of canary rockfish, from all fisheries and surveys, are reconstructed for years 1892-2022. These data are obtained from several sources:

<!-- -->

a.  In California catches came from state reconstructions, \gls{calcom}, \gls{recfin}, and \gls{pacfin}.
b.  In Oregon, catches were provided directly by \gls{odfw} and come from state reconstructions, \gls{pacfin}, and \gls{recfin}
c.  In Washington, recreational catches were provided directly by \gls{wdfw}. Historical commercial catches up to 1980 are based on those used in the previous assessment. Commercial catches from 1981--present are from \gls{pacfin}.
d.  Foreign trawl fleet catches from 1966-1976 are based on the previous assessment.\
e.  Total discards for recent years (2003-2014) are estimated in the annual mortality report using data from a variety of sources including the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program, and are publicly available: <http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/observation/data_products/species_management.cfm>.
f.  Discard rates for 1981-1994 are obtained from the Pikitch study as analyzed by J. Wallace.

2.  Fishery-independent data are included from three different surveys:

<!-- -->

a.  The Triennial survey conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center provides abundance index, length composition, and age-composition samples and was included for years 1980-2001;
b.  The \gls{s-wcgbts} conducted by the \gls{nwfsc} provides abundance index, length composition, and age-composition samples, and was available for years 2003-2022, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
c.  The pre-recruit survey, which combines data collected by the \gls{swfsc}, \gls{nwfsc}, and Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative provides a relative index of density for pre-recruit fish, and was included for most years from 2001-2022.

<!-- -->

3.  Fishery-dependent composition data are included from the following sources:

<!-- -->

a.  Length and age data from PacFIN
b.  Length data from RecFIN
c.  Length and age data from state sampling programs for Oregon and Washington
d.  Length and age data from at-sea hake bycatch

<!-- -->

4.  Estimates of life history parameters are generated from various sources, and include:

<!-- -->

a.  Updated maturity schedule, which now incorporates the average rate of skipped spawning, wherein mature individuals do not spawn in every year
b.  Fecundity information is similar to the previous assessment, as provided by E.J. Dick
c.  Updated prior for natural mortality rate
d.  Updated prior on steepness
e.  Updated weight-at-length relationship as estimated from the \gls{wcgbts}
f.  Updated estimates of ageing error, which now estimates bias and imprecision for surface-read otoliths, as necessary for their inclusion in the current assessment

These data sources are illustrated in Figure 3.

## Data sourced considered but not used

### California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCRFP)

The \gls{ccfrp} has conducted fishery-independent data collection efforts onboard commercial passenger fishing vessels both inside and outside of MPAs between 2007 and present. Aspects of canary rockfish life history make the data set less than ideal. One important consideration is the limitation of sampling to less than 150 ft to minimize barotrauma for fish released by this hook and line survey, which limits access to the primary depth distribution of adult canary rockfish. In addition, until 2017 the sampling was focused on central California at the southern edge of the species range in California. While additional data has been collected subsequently to better represent the statewide abundance of groundfish stocks, the limited depths sampled and spatial limitations early in the survey further the utility and representativeness of the survey for this northernly distributed stock. Lastly, the high degree of vagility of canary rockfish makes accounting for MPA effects of lesser importance reducing the impetus to account for trends in closed areas for this species.

### Commercial Collection Report System

From 1977-1985 Commercial Collection Report System (CCRS) provided data on commercial passenger fishing vessels sampled at dockside. This study was very limited in spatial scale, focusing efforts on a limited portion of the species range in the Monterey Bay area representing only the southern end of the distribution of canary rockfish. In addition, this region is unique in providing access to deeper depths a short distance from shore along the sub-marine canyons of Monterey and Carmel Bays potentially biasing representation relative to the entire coast north of Point Conception within California where they are commonly found. Though 488 canary rockfish were sampled during the duration of the survey limited geographic representation at the southern edge of the species range and lack of representation from other ports with more distant grounds on the shelf/slope limits the utility of this data and comparability to other data sets.

### Historical CDFW Dockside Sampling

A dockside sampling effort was undertaken by CDFW during the 1950s-1970s to collect data from the private and rental boat and party charter fleets. Data collected from 1958 to 1972 from Miller and Gotshall 1965. Miller and Geibel 1973 and efforts were made to digitize data from sample sites in the Monterey Bay Area from Ano Nuevo to Point Sur. Over the course of the survey, 1032 canary rockfish lengths were collected from party boats and 461 from private boats. The limited geographic representation at the southern edge of the species range and lack of representation from other ports with more distant grounds on the shelf/slope limits the utility of this data and comparability to other data sets.
