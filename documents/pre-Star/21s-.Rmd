## Fishery-Independent Data

Fishery-independent data are derived from three main sampling programs: the triennial survey (1980-2004), the West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey (WCGBTS; 2003-2014), and the pre-recruit survey.  Each source of information is used to generate an index of abundance.  The triennial and WCGBTS also provide age and length-composition sampling data.

### West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The NWFSC survey is based on a random-grid design, covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 700 fm. (Bradburn et al., 2011). This design uses four vessels per year (except in years 2004 and 2014, when only three vessels were available), assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells divided into two ‘passes’ of the coast executed from north to south. Two vessels fish during each pass. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (~700) of possible cells from a very large population of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian border. Much effort has been expended on appropriate analysis methods for this type of data (Helser et al., 2004; Shelton et al., 2014; Thorson et al., 2015b, 2012a, 2011; Thorson and Ward, 2013, 2014). 

The NWFSC survey encounters canary infrequently, generally in less than 10% of the total tows conducted (Table 3, including slope tows, beyond the depth distribution for canary). However, when canary aggregations are encountered catches can be as large as 4.9 mt in a single 12-15 minute tow; this equates to an average density of approximately 1 kg·2.5 m-2. During the period 2003-2006, there were only 10 tows that captured more than 500 kg of canary rockfish, 2004: 924 kg, 2005: 907 kg, 2006: 4,942, 1,250 and 653 kg, 2008: 536 kg, 2010: 1289 kg., 2011: 560 kg., 2012: 822 kg, 2014: 1588 kg. These large tows are located primarily off the northern Washington coast near the Canadian border, with some located off the Oregon or Northern California coasts. The presence of infrequent very large tows creates a strongly right-skewed distribution of catch rates, still visible after log-transformation. These very large catches do not appear to be dominated by either very large individuals or very small individuals, indicating that these areas represent neither recruitment ‘hot-spots’, nor unexploited ‘pockets’ of very old canary rockfish.

### Triennial Survey

The longest-running source of fishery-independent data regarding the abundance of canary rockfish is the triennial shelf trawl survey conducted by NMFS starting in 1977 (Dark and Wilkins, 1994). The sampling methods used in the survey over the 24-year period are most recently described in Weinberg et al. (2002); the basic design was a series of equally spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. In some parts of the coast this led to a very non-random allocation of stations with regard to the entire shelf area (Figure 4). In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the survey in 1977 was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the survey in 1992 spanned from mid-July through early October; the survey in 1995 was conducted from early June to late July; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001/2004 surveys were conducted in May-July. The initial year of the survey in 1977 was based on a sampling design that spanned from 50 to 260 fm. (91 to 475 m), i.e., it did not come as far inshore (30 fm.) as the subsequent surveys conducted on a triennial basis from 1980 to 2001. 

When estimating an index of abundance, we restrict analysis to depths from 55-366m and excluded tows outside to the US exclusive economic zone (i.e., in Canadian waters) to produce the only consistent time-series available. Surveys that have extended south of Monterey have detected only very small abundances relative to the north, so lack of sampling in this area does not influence the relative index. Because of the large number of ‘water hauls’ eliminated in 1977, especially in the US Vancouver INPFC area, and because the sampling depths were not the same as the other years, the 1977 survey year was not used in the assessment. A full description of the water haul issue can be found in Zimmerman et al. (2001). 

### Pre-recruit survey

A mid-water trawl survey of pre-recruit pelagic juvenile rockfish (Sebastes sp.) and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) has been conducted by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center since 1981. Until 2000, this survey consisted of 1-3 passes over a relatively limited area from 36º-39º North latitude (the “core-area”) off the central California coast (roughly 25% of the U.S. coastline). Beginning in 2001, the PWCC/NWFSC contributed a second vessel, and the geographic extent of this survey was dramatically increased to cover nearly the entire U.S. coastline. The survey spanned 35º-45º from 2001-2003, 33º-47º in 2004, and 33 º-48 º in 2005-2006. In 2006, a workshop was held to evaluate the application of pre-recruit indices as auxiliary information to estimate and predict year class strengths in stock assessments and to better understand how the distribution of specific species and the extent of survey coverage might influence the use of these data.  In this assessment, we use strata-specific estimates of pre-recruit densities, as provided by J. Field and S. Ralston (pers. comm., 2015)

### Other surveys

## Index Standardization

Data from the triennial and WCGBT surveys are typically analyzed using either design-based or delta-generalized linear mixed model methods.  The design-based method has the advantage of easy interpretation, but fails to account for the correlation among samples generated by the same vessel in the same year.  Failing to account for intra-class correlation, such as this, will generally cause the estimated standard error of an index to be negatively biased relative to the standard error with nominal coverage.  For this reason, indices of abundance on the West Coast are typically generated using the delta-GLMM model-based framework (Helser et al., 2004).  Design-based estimators may also represent a statistically inefficient use of available data (i.e., an estimation variance greater than a model-based estimator).  The delta-GLMM analysis framework separately estimates the probability of encountering at least one canary (as a logistic mixed regression) and the distribution of catches for tows with at least one canary (a generalized linear mixed model).  The delta-GLMM also includes each vessel in each year as an independent random effect, representing the selection of vessels for the contracted survey from a population of potential fishing vessels on the US West Coast bottom trawl fishery.  
	
Recent research has termed the large and infrequent catches observed for canary and many other rockfishes “extreme catch events” (ECEs; (Thorson et al., 2011)).  Thorson et al. (2011) dealt with them during index standardization by treating the distribution of positive catches as a mixture distribution composed of the distributions for solitary individuals, and the distribution for fish shoals (treated as a loglinear offset from the distribution of solitary individuals).  Simulation testing indicates that this treatment of fish shoals decreases the sampling variance that otherwise occurs from a few infrequent observations have large leverage (Thorson et al., 2012a).  

	More recent research has advocated the use of geostatistical delta-GLMMs for analyzing survey data of patchy species such as canary rockfish (Shelton et al., 2014).   This advice was supported by a recent comparison of stratified and geostatistical delta-GLMMs for West Coast species, where the geostatistical method decreased the imprecision of estimated abundance indices on average for simulated data (Thorson et al., 2015b).  The geostatistical approach to index standardization treats spatial variation in either encounter rates of positive catch rates as a random function, where the value of this random function at 1000 pre-defined locations (“knots”) is treated as a random effect.  In this way, annual variation and the magnitude of residual variation and variation among vessels can be treated as fixed effects, and estimated via maximum marginal likelihood.  

	We analyze data from the triennial survey using version 1.0.0 of the Bayesian stratified delta-GLMM, implemented as an R package BayesDeltaGLM and publicly available here: https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscDeltaGLM.  A full description of this model can be found in Thorson and Ward (2013, 2014).  We include Julian calendar date as a covariate during analysis of data 1980-2004 to account for differences in availability due to changes in timing of the survey (i.e., before and after 1995).  We include three spatial strata, corresponding to the three strata in our base model, and also exclude any data with depth <55m or >366m (i.e., only using data for within the range of depths where canary are present).  We select among eight candidate models, formed from the combination of four potential distributions for positive catch rates (lognormal, gamma, lognormal-ECE, gamma-ECE) and two potential treatments of spatiotemporal variation (including or not including the interaction of spatial stratum and year as a random effect).  All models are run using three independent Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, where each simulation involves 100,000 samples as burn-in, followed by 100,000 monitored samples, with a thinning rate of 100 (i.e., retaining 3,000 samples across all three simulations).  We checked for evidence of non-convergence by visual inspection of mixing in sampling chains for all estimated and derived parameters, and found no evidence of non-convergence.  DIC was used to select among candidate models, and supported the use of the gamma-ECE model with a stratum-year interaction treated as random.  To check for evidence of poor model fit, we display the Bayesian quantile-quantile plot, generated by calculating the posterior quantile of each datum relative to the predictive distribution of the fitted model, and then comparing the distribution of mean-quantiles with a null distribution.  This Q-Q plot (Figure 5) reveals no evidence that the stratified delta-GLMM fails to capture the variability present in the positive catch rates of the triennial data.   We then extract indices of abundance for each of the three strata.  These indices show similar trends in abundance in all three strata, where relative abundance reached a low-point around the 1995 survey and has since exhibited some degree of rebuilding (Figure 6).  

	We analyze data from the WCGBTS using version 3.2.0 of the geostatistical model, implemented as an R package SpatialDeltaGLMM and publicly available here: https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM.  This software uses Template Model Builder (Kristensen, 2014; Kristensen et al., 2016) to integrate across the latent probability of random effects, when maximizing the marginal likelihood function (Thorson and Minto, 2015).  We additionally include pass (levels: first or second) as a covariate in the model, to account for unbalanced sampling between the first and second passes in years 2004 and 2014.  We select among four potential model treatments, i.e., treating positive catch rates as following a lognormal, gamma, lognormal-ECE, or gamma-ECE distribution.  The model using the gamma-ECE distribution did not converge, and AIC indicated greatest support for the lognormal-ECE distribution among other model options.  We therefore used the geostatistical model with the lognormal-ECE distribution to generate an index of abundance for the WCGBTS for years 2003-2014.  Following advice from the Science and Statistical Committee, we display the Quantile-Quantile plot, generated by comparing each observed datum with its predicted distribution under the fitted model, calculating the quantile of that datum, and comparing the distribution of quantiles with its expectation under a null model (i.e., a uniform distribution).  This Q-Q plot is shown in Figure 7, and shows no evidence that the model fails to capture the shape of dispersion shown in the positive catch rate data.  The estimated spatial distribution of canary densities is shown in Figure 8, and shows that the highest densities are predicted to occur in Northern Washington, where the extreme catch events are most often clustered.  This estimated density throughout the WCGBTS sampling domain is then post-processed to generate three separate indices of abundance, corresponding to the three spatial strata used in the base model (CA: 32-42°N, OR: 42-46°N, WA: 46-49°N), and coast-wide areas between depths of 55 and 366 m.  These indices are shown in Figure 9 and, as expected, the greatest estimated abundance occurs in WA, followed by OR and with substantially lower abundance in CA. 

	As recommended by the PFMC Science and Statistical Committee (SSC) during its review of the geostatistical index standardization approach, we also estimated an index of abundance while analyzing the WCGBTS using the Bayesian stratified delta-GLMM (again using v1.0.0 of the R package BayesDeltaGLM).  We select among the same either models as were explored when analyzing data from the triennial survey.  For each model, we use three chains with 100,000 burn-in and 100,000 monitored samples with a thin rate of 100 per chain. 
We again check for evidence of non-converge using trace-plots, the Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic, and autocorrelation plots, and find no evidence of non-convergence for any model.  DIC selects a model using the gamma-ECE distribution with a random strata-year interaction, and the Quantile-Quantile plot for this model (Figure 10) provides no evidence for a lack of model fit.  

A comparison of stratified and geostatistical indices of abundance, with the design-based estimate also shown (Figure 11) illustrates that the design-based index is highly sensitive to extreme catch events, as previously reported (Thorson et al., 2011).  The stratified and geostatistical indices are generally similar coast-wide and for each individual stratum, although the geostatistical model has slightly smaller intervals, as predicted by Thorson et al. (2015b).  We later present a sensitivity analysis when including the index estimated by the stratified model in the base assessment model, compared with using the geostatistical index.
