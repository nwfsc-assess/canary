## Fishery-Independent Data

Fishery-independent data are derived from three main sampling programs: the \gls{s-tri} (1980-2004), the \gls{s-wcgbt}, and the pre-recruit survey (2001-2022). Each source of information is used to generate an index of abundance. The triennial and WCGBTS also provide age and length-composition sampling data and were extracted on May 1, 2023 and February 13, 2023, respectively.

### West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The WCGBTS is based on a random-grid design, covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design uses four vessels per year (except in years 2004 and 2014, when only three vessels were available, and 2020 when the survey did not occur due to COVID-19), assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells divided into two 'passes'. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The WCGBTS encounters canary infrequently, generally in less than 10% of the total tows conducted, though this includes slope tows well beyond the depth canary inhabit (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts}). However, when canary aggregations are encountered, catches can be as large as 4.9 mt in a single 12-15 minute tow; this equates to an average density of approximately 1 kgÂ·2.5 m$^{-2}$. There are 19 tows that have encountered at least 500 kg of canary, and four tows have encountered over 1000 kg (2088 kg in 2015, 3033 kg in 2017, 3650 kg in 2018, and 3984 kg in 2006). These large tows are located primarily off the northern Washington coast near the Canadian border, with some located off the Oregon or Northern California coasts. The presence of infrequent very large tows creates a strongly right-skewed distribution of catch rates, still visible after log-transformation. These very large catches do not appear to be dominated by either very large individuals or very small individuals, indicating that these areas represent neither recruitment 'hot-spots', nor unexploited 'pockets' of very old canary rockfish.

### Triennial Survey

Prior to the \gls{s-wcgbt}, the triennial shelf trawl survey conducted by NMFS starting in 1977 served as the main fishery-independent data source regarding the abundance of canary rockfish in the California Current [@dark_distribution_1994]. The sampling methods used in the survey over the 24-year period are most recently described in Weinberg et al. [-@weinberg_2001_2002]; the basic design was a series of equally spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. In some parts of the coast this led to a very non-random allocation of stations with regard to the entire shelf area. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the survey in 1977 was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the survey in 1992 spanned from mid-July through early October; the survey in 1995 was conducted from early June to late July; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001/2004 surveys were conducted in May-July. The initial year of the survey in 1977 was based on a sampling design that spanned from 50 to 260 fm (91 to 475 m) and did not come as far inshore (30 fm) as the subsequent surveys conducted on a triennial basis from 1980 to 2001.

Surveys that have extended south of Monterey have detected only very small abundances relative to the north, so changes in sampling in this area does not influence the relative index. Because of the large number of 'water hauls' eliminated in 1977, especially in the U.S. Vancouver INPFC area, and because the sampling depths were not the same as the other years, the 1977 survey year was not used in the assessment. A full description of the water haul issue can be found in Zimmerman et al. [-@zimmermann_retrospective_2001].

### Pre-recruit survey

The Fishery Ecology Division of the \gls{swfsc} has conducted a standardized pelagic juvenile trawl survey (the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey) during May-June every year since 1983 [@ralston_juvrockfish_2013; @sakuma2016anomalous; @field2021spatiotemporal]. A primary purpose of the survey is to estimate the abundance of pelagic juvenile rockfishes (*Sebastes spp.*) and to develop indices of year-class strength for use in groundfish stock assessments on the U. S. West Coast. This is possible because the survey samples young-of-the-year rockfish when they are \~100 days old, an ontogenetic stage that occurs after year-class strength is established, but well before cohorts recruit to commercial and recreational fisheries. This survey has encountered tremendous interannual variability in the abundance of the species that are routinely indexed, as well as high apparent synchrony in abundance among the ten most frequently encountered species [@ralston_juvrockfish_2013]. Past assessments have used data from this survey to provide indices of year-class strength (as relative age-0 abundance), including the 2015 Canary rockfish assessment, and assessments for widow rockfish [@adams_status_2019], blue/deacon rockfish [@dick2018bluedeacon], bocaccio [@he_status_2015], shortbelly rockfish [@field_status_2007], and chilipepper rockfish [@field_status_2015].

Historically, the survey was conducted between $36^\circ 30^\prime$N and $38^\circ 20^\prime$N latitude (the 'core area' from approximately Carmel, CA to just north of Point Reyes, CA), but starting in 2004 the spatial coverage expanded to cover from the U.S./Mexico border to Cape Mendocino. Additionally, since 2001 data are available from comparable surveys conducted by the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative and the \gls{nwfsc} (2001--2009) and the \gls{nwfsc} "Pre-recruit" survey (2011--2022) for waters off of Oregon and Washington [@field_spatiotemporal_2021]. Coastwide data have revealed both spatial differences in species composition (e.g. north and south of Point Conception) and interannual shifts in the distribution of most pelagic juvenile rockfishes: The near absence of fish in the core survey area during the 2005--2007 period, which saw two of the lowest abundance levels of juvenile rockfish ever observed in the core area time series, was associated with an apparent redistribution of fish, both to the north and the south [@ralston_prerecruit_2013]. As the core area index seems to have failed to capture the magnitude of the 1999 year class for most stocks, the recommendations from the juvenile rockfish survey workshop held in 2005 were to use only the coastwide data (since 2001) for juvenile indices rather than the longer-term 'core area' indices unless a convincing case could be made otherwise. We used data from 2001 to 2022, the period for which we have coastwide coverage. On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, sampling in 2020 was very limited and restricted to the historical core area, so this year is excluded. In the years 2010, 2012, and 2022, sampling did not span the entire coastwide spatial domain, with data lacking from northern CA and OR. These years were not included in the model, but sensitivity of the stock assessment to inclusion of the index for these years is explored in sensitivities.

Catch per tow was adjusted to a common age of 100 days to account for interannual differences in age structure, as has been done for prior assessment indices using this dataset.

### Index standardization

Geostatistical models of biomass density were fit to all three survey datasets using \gls{tmb} [@kristensen_tmb:_2016] via the R package \gls{sdmtmb} [@Anderson:2022:SRP]. These models can account for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random field and spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a random walk Guassian random field [@thorson_geostatistical_2015]. Tweedie, delta-binomial, delta-gamma, and mixture distributions, which allow for extreme catch events, were investigated. Results are only shown for the distribution that led to the best model diagnostics, e.g., similar distributions of theoretical normal quantiles and model quantiles, high precision, lack of extreme predictions that are incompatible with the life history, and low \gls{aic}. Estimates of biomass from this best model were predicted using a grid based on available survey locations. Code to reproduce the analysis is [publicly available](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/indexwc).

#### \gls{s-wcgbt}

The data were truncated to depths less than 275 m prior to modelling given that there were zero positive encounters in depths deeper than 275 m. The prediction grid was also truncated to only include available survey locations in depths between 55--275 m to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects.

The model used a delta model with a lognormal distribution for the catch-rate component. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. Pass was also included as a covariate. Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey, were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of commercial vessels used during sampling [@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014].

Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter probability model and spatial variation was included in the positive catch rate model. The variance of the spatiotemporal effect was estimated to be less than 0.01 for the positive catch rate model and was therefore not included in the final model. Spatial variation was approximated using 200 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.

#### \gls{s-tri}

The data were truncated to depths less than 366 m and latitudes north of $37^\circ$N prior to modelling to control for temporal changes in survey extent. No canary were ever encountered below 366 m and only 13 tows encountered canary south of $37^\circ$N out of 831 total tows that encountered canary. The data also excluded any tows outside of the U.S. exclusive economic zone (i.e., in Canadian waters). The prediction grid was truncated to these same extents to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects.

The model used a delta model with a lognormal distribution for the catch-rate component. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. No other covariates were modeled. Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey, were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of commercial vessels used during sampling [@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014].

Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter probability model and spatial variation was included in the positive catch rate model. The variance of the spatiotemporal effect was estimated to be less than 0.01 for the positive catch rate model and was therefore not included in the final model. Spatial variation was approximated using 200 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.

#### Pre-recruit survey

For the index model, we used data from 35--$48.2^\circ$N latitude (just north of Point Conception to La Push, WA). Canary rockfish were never caught south of $35^\circ$N. Since catch (and sampling) varied over space and time, we modeled catch using a spatial GLM with the package \gls{sdmtmb} [@Anderson:2022:SRP]. The 100-day-standardized catch per tow was modeled as a function of fixed year effects along with Julian date (GAM smoother with k=4) to account for seasonality, a spatial random field, and IID spatiotemporal random fields.

We fit the model using 3 different error structures: tweedie, delta-lognormal, and delta-gamma. Dharma quantile residuals from model simulations suggested that tweedie distribution was the best fit, and so was used. The tweedie model also best reproduced the observed proportion of zeros in the data based on simulations from the fitted model. As expected, the Julian date effect showed a decline in catch towards the end of the sampling season, as juveniles begin to settle out of the water column.

For the coastwide index, predictions from the model were made for all active sample stations within the survey region, for the mean Julian date, for each year. Predictions were added together for each year to produce the index. Active stations are those regularly and consistently sampled, and are located on a semi-regular grid spanning the sampling region. Interpolating to a finer spatial grid had little impact on the resulting index.


### Survey composition data {#survey-composition-data}

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wcgbts.summary <- readr::read_csv(here('documents/tables/wcgbts_summary.csv'))
triennial.summary <- readr::read_csv(here('documents/tables/triennial_summary.csv'))
```

Biological data were extracted from the \gls{nwfsc} data warehouse on February 13, 2023 for the \gls{s-wcgbt} and May 1, 2023 for the \gls{s-tri}. For the length-composition samples from the \gls{s-wcgbt}, data bins are populated with a modest, but consistent degree of sampling: `r min(wcgbts.summary[,'N positive tows'])`-`r max(wcgbts.summary[,'N positive tows'])` tows and `r min(wcgbts.summary[,'N lengths'])`-`r max(wcgbts.summary[,'N lengths'])` fish lengths per year (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts}). The \gls{s-tri} (Table \ref{tab:triennial}) had both more positive tows each year (`r min(triennial.summary[,'N positive tows'])`-`r max(triennial.summary[,'N positive tows'])`) and more fish lengths per year (`r min(triennial.summary[,'N lengths'])`-`r max(triennial.summary[,'N lengths'])`). Compositions and input sample sizes were calculated by standard procedures in the [`nwfscSurvey` package](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/nwfscSurvey) using sample size multipliers from Stewart and Hamel [-@stewart_bootstrapping_2014] for shelf rockfish ($2.43*N_{\text{tow}}$) and the following strata separations:

-   \gls{s-wcgbt} latitudes: 32 (Mexican border), 34.5 (change in survey design), 42 (California-Oregon border), 46 (Oregon-Washington border), 49 (Canadian border) degrees North
-   \gls{s-wcgbt} depths: 55 (minimum survey extent), 183 (change in survey design), 350 (depth limit of canary rockfish) meters
-   \gls{s-tri} latitudes: 37 (southernmost latitude with consistent sampling across years), 42, 46, 49 degrees (as noted above) degrees North
-   \gls{s-tri} depths: 55 (minimum survey extent), 183 (change in survey design), 350 (depth limit of canary rockfish) meters

State strata were included to account for the fact that age and length tends to increase northward along the coast [@keller2018canary; @Brooks_thesis_2021]. 

The survey length-frequency distributions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:wcgbts_lencomp}-\ref{fig:trilate_lencomp} and indicate the \gls{s-wcgbt} catches a wide range of lengths with generally little change in size over time, and that lengths in the \gls{s-tri} were also similar over time except smaller sizes in 1992 and larger sizes in 2004. 

The conditional-age-at-length samples consist of approximately one-quarter as many fish as the samples for length (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts} and \ref{tab:triennial}). These distributions show a tight range of ages at a given length, and show the growth trajectory of females reaching larger sizes than males for a given age (see Section \@ref(biology)). Besides the addition of recent survey years, this assessment also includes data for the first time from recently aged otoliths from the 1986 \gls{s-tri}. Compositions were again calculated using the `nwfscSurvey` package and the same strata as the length compositions, with input sample sizes fixed at the number of unique fish within a given length bin [@wetzel2023nwfscdiag].
