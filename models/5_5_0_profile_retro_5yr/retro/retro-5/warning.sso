Warning 10 Adjustment:  recdev_end: 2022 > retro_yr: 2017 reset 
Warning 11 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 15 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.

Warning 13 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
