Note 1 Information: Max harvest rate typically is >1.0 for F_method 2, 3 or 4 0.9
Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 15 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 9.29535e-09; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 0.000585786 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 2 Information: No *.ss_new and fewer *.sso files written after mceval
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 5; check results, variance may be suspect
