Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Note 2 Information: Max harvest rate typically is >1.0 for F_method 2, 3 or 4 0.9
Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 19 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 2.02285e-10; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 0.00238814 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 3 Information: No *.ss_new and fewer *.sso files written after mceval
Warning 4 : Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  20
Note 4 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 4; check results, variance may be suspect
