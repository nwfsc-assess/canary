Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 2 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 5.97669e-08; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 4 : Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  4
Note 1 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
 4 warnings  and 1 note
