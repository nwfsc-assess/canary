Warning 1 : Block:1 2 ends in: 2022 after retroyr+1:  2021
Warning 2 : Block:2 2 ends in: 2022 after retroyr+1:  2021
Warning 3 : Block:3 2 ends in: 2022 after retroyr+1:  2021
Warning 4 : Block:4 2 ends in: 2022 after retroyr+1:  2021
Warning 5 Adjustment:  recdev_end: 2022 > retro_yr: 2020 reset 
Warning 6 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 2 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 7 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 5.97669e-08; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 8 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Note 1 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
