Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 2 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : Minimum pop size bin:_8; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 7.94527
Warning 3 : Minimum pop size bin:_8; is > L at Amin for sex: 2; Gpat: 1; L= 7.94527
Warning 4 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.83432e-09; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 5 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 6 : Final gradient: 0.000216071 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 1 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
