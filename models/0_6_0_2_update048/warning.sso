Note 1 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 21 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.40961e-08; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
