Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 17 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 7.56392e-09; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
