Warning 7 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 2 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 8 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.48166e-10; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 9 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
