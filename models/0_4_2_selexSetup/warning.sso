Note 1 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 21 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 3 : adjusted MGparm out of base parm bounds. Phase: 6; Inter: 1255; parm#: 24; y: 2005; min: -7; max: 7; base: 4.10011 timevary_val: 8.36519 RecrDist_Area_3
Warning 4 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 10
Warning 5 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 13
Warning 6 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 14
Warning 7 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 15
Warning 8 : Forecast F capped by max possible F from control file4
Warning 9 : adjusted MGparm out of base parm bounds. Phase: 6; Inter: 1255; parm#: 24; y: 2005; min: -7; max: 7; base: 4.10011 timevary_val: 8.36519 RecrDist_Area_3

Warning 13 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 15
Warning 14 : Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  20
Note 2 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
