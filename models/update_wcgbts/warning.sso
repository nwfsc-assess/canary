Note 1 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Note 2 Information: Max harvest rate typically is >1.0 for F_method 2, 3 or 4 0.9
Warning 25 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 23 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 26 : Final gradient: 0.000619113 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
