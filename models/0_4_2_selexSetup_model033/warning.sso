Note 1 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Note 2 Information: Max harvest rate typically is >1.0 for F_method 2, 3 or 4 0.9
Warning 1 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 21 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 2 : adjusted MGparm out of base parm bounds. Phase: 5; Inter: 1210; parm#: 24; y: 2005; min: -7; max: 7; base: 4.25941 timevary_val: 8.50499 RecrDist_Area_3
Warning 3 : Forecast F capped by max possible F from control file0.9
Note 3 Information: No *.ss_new and fewer *.sso files written after mceval
Warning 4 : adjusted MGparm out of base parm bounds. Phase: 5; Inter: 1210; parm#: 24; y: 2005; min: -7; max: 7; base: 4.25941 timevary_val: 8.50499 RecrDist_Area_3
Warning 5 : Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  20
Note 4 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
